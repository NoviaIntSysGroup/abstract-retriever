      "Maritime Digital Twin architecture: A concept for holistic Digital Twin application for shipbuilding and shipping\n",
      "Digital Twins (DTs) play an important role in current digitalization trends across industries. As maritime markets are particularly affected by recent global tendencies such as increasing delivery costs or political pressure for decarbonization, DT solutions could provide important support for shipbuilding and shipping companies to master recent and upcoming challenges. This paper provides a brief insight into the current state of the maritime industry and shows possible use-cases for DT Ship applications throughout the entire product lifecycle. To further advance the general understanding of DTs and their implementation, the concept of a Maritime Digital Twin Architecture (MDTA) is proposed to structure practical DT features.\n",

      "Real-time digital twin for ship operation in waves\n",
      "This paper introduces a real-time digital twin for ship operations in seaways. The concept of the digital twin is becoming popular, and it is adopted for ship operation systems in this study. In particular, this paper introduces a new and innovative concept of the digital twin to predict ocean waves and hydrodynamic performances, such as seakeeping and maneuvering, which enables the risk and optimum route to be forecast in real time. An essential element in the realization of such a real-time digital twin is the real-time prediction of ocean waves. Hence, a sophisticated algorithm for wave reconstruction using measured wave-radar images is developed, which is extended to predicting the future evolution of a three-dimensional wave field in front of a ship within a time window of the order of 10 min. As another essential element, an analysis program to solve the coupled seakeeping-maneuvering problem is developed. This analysis can also be used in real time. By combining this with wave prediction software, the future occurrence of ocean waves and ship responses can be predicted. By extending this approach, the risk and performance of ships in various ocean environments can be predicted. In this paper, concepts, approaches, and examples are introduced.\n",

      "Real-time digital twin of research vessel for remote monitoring\n",
      "Real-time digital twins of ships in operation find many applications such as predictive maintenance, climbing the ladders of ship autonomy, and offshore operational excellence. The literature describes a focus on digital twinning of individual equipment such as navigation, propulsion, engine and power system, or crane. Yet, digital twinning and virtual prototyping for offshore operations are in their infancy and the onboard digitisation hardware and the telecommunication infrastructure are becoming accessible and affordable. Previous work has failed to address the need for building a holistic model and thus contextualising the equipment with the state of the whole vessel. A prototype of an online digital twin of a research vessel is proposed, its architecture described and its suitability for virtual prototyping demonstrated in a remote control centre. The study shows a viable proof of concept for remote monitoring and crew assistance in nominal and contingency response for offshore crane operations.\n",

      "This paper highlights the development of Digital Twin (DT) technology and its admittance to a variety of applications within the maritime domain in general and surface ships in particular. The conceptual theory behind the evolution of DT is highlighted along with the development of the technology and current progress in practical applications with an exploration of the key milestones in the extension from the electrification of the shipping sector towards the realization of a definitive DT-based system. Existing DT-based applications within the maritime sector are surveyed along with the comprehension of ongoing research work. The development strategy for a formidable DT architecture is discussed, culminating in a proposal of a four-layered DT framework. Considering the importance of DT, an extensive and methodical literature survey has also been carried out, along with a comprehensive scientometric analysis to unveil the methodical footprint of DT in the marine sector, thus leading the way for future work on the design, development and operation of surface vessels using DT applications.\n",

      "From digital twin to maritime data space: Transparent ownership and use of ship information\n",
      "The concept of the digital twin is gaining momentum in the maritime industry, but it brings with it new questions about data ownership and governance. Given the wide range of different data that can be stored in the digital twin, it is not clear if all these data can be stored in the same data base or even use the same governance model. Within the Industrie 4.0 framework, a concept called \"Industrial Data Space\" (IDS) has been developed to cater to these problems for land-based industry. With the advent of \"Shipping 4.0\" as the Industrie 4.0 of the seas, we propose a similar concept as IDS for the maritime world, called \"Maritime Data Space\" (MDS). This will be an extension of IDS but will be adapted to the specific nature of shipping and, hence, a modified digital trust framework, lower connectivity for ships at sea and the highly heterogenous control and physical systems architecture on ships. However, MDS will still be a part of the IDS ecosystem and gain benefit from the further developments in IDS and its applications.\n",

      "Data-driven ship digital twin for estimating the speed loss caused by the marine fouling\n",
      "Shipping is responsible for approximately the 90% of world trade leading to significant impacts on the environment. As a consequence, a crucial issue for the maritime industry is to develop technologies able to increase the ship efficiency, by reducing fuel consumption and unnecessary maintenance operations. For example, the marine fouling phenomenon has a deep impact, since to prevent or reduce its growth which affects the ship consumption, costly drydockings for cleaning the hull and the propeller are needed and must be scheduled based on a speed loss estimation. In this work a data driven Digital Twin of the ship is built, leveraging on the large amount of information collected from the on-board sensors, and is used for estimating the speed loss due to marine fouling. A thorough comparison between the proposed method and ISO 19030, which is the de-facto standard for dealing with this task, is carried out on real-world data coming from two Handymax chemical/product tankers. Results clearly show the effectiveness of the proposal and its better speedloss prediction accuracy with respect to the ISO 19030, thus allowing reducing the fuel consumption due to fouling.\n",

      "Challenges when creating a cohesive digital twin ship: a data modelling perspective\n",
      "A digital twin is a digital asset that simulates the behaviours of a physical counterpart. Digital twin ship literature identifies that the concept is already being applied to specialised problems, but no clear guide exists for creating broader interdisciplinary digital twins. Relevant dimensions of product data modelling and previous attempts at standardizing ship data elucidate the requirements for effective data modelling in a digital twin context. Such requirements are placed in a broader perspective for digital twin implementation that encompasses challenges and directions for future development of services, networks, and software. Finally, an open standardization for digital twin data is proposed based on lessons extracted from this panorama, proposing its application to a research vessel.\n",

      "This paper presents the future possibilities of the digital twin in the Maritime Industry and the solutions to optimize the use throughout the lifecycle of the vessel. Especially in relation to Autonomous vessels the Digital Twin will play a crucial role in optimal performance of a vessel. The Maritime industry is fragmented and the original builder of the Digital Twin, the shipyard, is in most cases not the owner who is operating the vessel for a period of 20 to 30 years. Also the class societies are part of this value chain and should adapt their approval process and inspection process to serve the Digital Twin. A collaboration between the parties involved is absolute necessary and will introduce a new view on the Maritime industry and new business models for the shipyards.\n",

      "Today, modelling and simulation technologies are extensively used in the maritime industry. As a reaction to changing market demands and environmental challenges, maritime systems are becoming more complex and coupled. Digital approaches such as digital twins and co-simulation are coping these challenges and offer new opportunities throughout the lifecycle of a vessel. In this work, we present the digital twin modelling and the co-simulation of a typical AC ship power and propulsion system including the power stage, relevant local controllers and a high-level controller. The power and control components are modelled individually and exported as Functional Mock-up Units (FMUs). To perform a co-simulation of the ship electric power system, the Open Simulation Platform (OSP) is utilized. This co-simulation environment connects the individual FMUs and routes the data between the sub-simulators of the digital twin. A typical test scenario is carried out to demonstrate the correct functioning of the ship power and propulsion system as well as the OSP environment.\n",

      "Security in IoT-Enabled Digital Twins of Maritime Transportation Systems\n",
      "The purposes are to explore the safety performance of the Maritime Transportation System (MTS) based on Digital Twins (DTs) Internet of Things (IoT) and develop maritime transportation towards intelligence and digitalization. Because the comprehensive operational security of modern MTS is not yet mature, historical transportation data of the Maritime Silk Road are acquired and preprocessed. Afterward, DTs are introduced, and relay nodes are added to data transmission paths to construct a maritime transportation DTs model based on relay cooperation IoT. Eventually, this model’s security performance is validated through simulation experiments. Relay security analysis suggests that interference information is a vital guarantee to assist in information non-disclosure, from which the constructed model can harvest energy to increase the data transmission power, thereby improving communication performance and secrecy rate. Outage probability analysis reveals that the simulated and the theoretical results are almost the same; moreover, given the system’s multi-hop paths in the same environment, the more the relays and the greater the fading index, the better the system performance and the lower the outage probability. Once the iterations reach a particular number, the node secrecy rate becomes optimal and cannot cause excessive burden to the system; besides, the power distribution can establish a new equilibrium when the nodes are in different locations, so that system security performance gets improved. The simulated value is closest to the actual result under 100% successful transmission probability and 0.01∼0.05 λ value. To sum up, the constructed maritime transportation DTs model presents extraordinary transmission and security performance, providing an experimental basis for intelligent and secure maritime transportation in the future.\n",

      "A Digital Twin of the Research Vessel Gunnerus for Lifecycle Services: Outlining Key Technologies\n",
      "Digitalization has become a key aspect of making maritime industries more innovative, efficient, and fit for future operations. One of the most attractive aspects is the concept of digital twins , which refers to digital replicas of physical assets, processes, and systems that can be used as advanced tools for design, operation, and maintenance. This article introduces the development of the digital twin of the research vessel (RV) Gunnerus in Norway, which will be a significant scientific and operational achievement for the maritime industry, making efficient and safe offshore operations possible. It enables data exchange safely and easily among different subsystems, modules, and various applications. Thus, the twin ship can provide an integrated view of the ship’s various physical and behavioral aspects in different stages and allow simultaneous optimization of functional performance requirements. In addition, it enables advanced control and optimization, e.g., creating more reliable prediction for flexible objectives (time, output, emissions, fuel consumption), and executing day-ahead and long-term planning for operations. Several related applications are presented in the end to confirm the effectiveness of the digital twin ship system.\n",

      "Digital twin for ship life-cycle: A critical systematic review\n",
      "The focus on digitalisation in manufacturing is spreading to other industry fields, including large and complex objects like ships. Such interest introduces the concept of Digital Twins in supporting designers and operators through the whole ship-life cycle. However, the term Digital Twin is typically abused in the shipping industry, many times erroneously referring to any virtual version of a model-based system as a Digital Twin of the ship. The mutual data exchange between the physical and virtual environment, which is the basis of a true Digital Twin, is mostly missing, confusing a virtual model with a sophisticated living virtual environment. Few reviews are available in the literature for Digital Twins on ships. This systematic review proposes the identification of weaknesses and correlations between current Digital Twin applications in the maritime industry and other industry fields. Furthermore, the methodology applied here may be repeated in future studies to provide a fair and objective overview of the research advancements in the topic. The study highlighted how literature scarcely addresses the design and decommissioning phases, indicating that research should focus on these topics, especially concerning the design of future ships.\n",

      "We propose the use of existing data standards and web technologies to modeling and development of digital twin ships. Our research provides an open framework that can be linked to services such as visualizations, simulations and remote control. The case study applies the standards-based framework to an experiment that involved a scale model ship equipped with a dynamic positioning system under artificial waves. The digital twin prototype illustrated the capability of mirroring and controlling the model’s position in real-time, and predicting motion responses across wave conditions via a web application. Thus, it closes the loop between test and design in the life cycle by allowing validation of results in comparison to empirical data during operation. The results from these experiments are used to discuss an expanded version of the digital twin for validation and optimization of motion response, as well as its implications to the system’s (ship) taxonomy and data management. The conclusion summarizes lessons when using the adopted standards, as well as challenges when scaling the approach to real life operations. Future research is proposed toward extending the standardization to more complex cases.\n",

      "Ship digital twin architecture for optimizing sailing automation\n",
      "A fully autonomous ship should be monitored in a digital environment to track its real-time response to the changes in its surroundings. It is commanded by a controller algorithm whose optimum parameters is subject to change with respect to the changes in the environment. The ship's response with respect to these variations in the controller parameters need to be tracked to develop a full understanding of the ship's autonomy. As such, it is believed that the digital twin of a ship is an essential component of the path to fully autonomous ships. Despite maritime institutions not giving the credit to it yet, the ship digital twin concept is expected to be one of the leading topics in marine engineering soon. In this study, we try to establish the ship digital twin concept in terms of navigation autonomy. The paper starts by introducing the path to full autonomy in seas and the need for the digital twin by defining this concept for ships. A maneuvering mathematical model is used to represent the physical ship. The details of the model and the controller algorithms are given next. The propeller and rudder models are first validated by free-running self-propulsion and turning circle tests. The ship considered in this study has a twisted rudder and does not possess course-keeping ability; therefore, it requires autopilot to move straight ahead. Three types of simulation cases are identified with one being the autopilot mode. In the other two cases, the ship is forced to conduct two hard maneuvers while accelerating/decelerating. Investigation of the generated results reveals the effectiveness of the digital twin architecture used in this study. It has also allowed us to conduct a controller stability analysis, which has shown the behavior of the controller gains to detect the most optimum values for the considered model ship.\n",

      "New Trends on Digital Twin-Based Blockchain Technology in Zero-Emission Ship Applications\n",
      "Nowadays, with the widespread industrial use of digital data and relative maturity of the Internet of fiings (IoT), and data analytics (artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML), and data visualization), we can design, customize, and implement plenty of systems which once were unimaginable. A combination of the mentioned fields leads to the emergence of new technology, i.e., Digital Twins (DT). The potentials of DT in different fields have changed the perspective of most academia/industry leaders around the world. The fundamental concept of DT lies in developing the living and intelligent model which faithfully mimics the physical system during the lifetime of the physical ones. Indeed, by co-evolving with the physical system, the DT can precisely explore the design flaws of the virtual environment and make quick changes, which will ameliorate the design, prevent tedious confirmation and experiments. In this review research, the principle definitions, architecture, and characteristics of DT as well as the enabling key technologies of this context are briefiy provided; after that, the ranges of applications of DT in manufacturing and industry will be presented. In particular, the evaluation details and challenges related to the zero-emission ships along with its DT model, which recently have been getting attention in academia, industry, and government, have been discussed. Eventually, the standardized application of blockchain technology, regarded as distributed ledger technology (DLT), will be introduced as a practical solution for data storage, data access, data sharing, data security, and data integrity in the DT.\n",

      "With the continuous increase of maritime activities and services, it is imperative to establish the “Smart Ocean” architecture, to promote more efficient and safe marine information dissemination with high quality of service provisioning. In this paper, we propose a digital twin (DT) assisted maritime networking architecture based on a comprehensive review of the maritime networks, where the roles and superiority of DT are emphasized with the consideration of the network heterogeneity and dynamics. We utilize the interaction between virtual and physical entities to improve the flexibility and adaptability of the network, aiming at more efficient maritime network resource management and optimization. We then discuss the main challenges and some potential research issues in DT-assisted marine network design. The proposed maritime networking architecture based on DT can provide a good reference for network planning and deployment of maritime networking architecture to adapt to different marine environments.\n",

      "Ship’s Digital Twin—A Review of Modelling Challenges and Applications\n",
      "Abstract\n",
      "The Ship’s Digital Twin (SDT) is a digital record of a ship’s behaviour or a software clone, which can be used to simulate scenarios that are expensive or hardly feasible to perform on a real object and especially in real time. The purpose of the SDT is to achieve cost reduction, obtain timely warnings of irregularities, and optimise individual ship system performances or the operation of the whole ship and to assist ship management. The aim of this paper is to describe the concept of the SDT and clarify some perplexities that may occur from initial introduction to concept. To that end, the paper identifies the steps in the SDT formulation process and methods used in each step of the process. Furthermore, a four-step iterative procedure for the SDT development is proposed. The applications of the concept are numerous, and some of them are presented in a review analysis in this paper. The presented analysis leads to a conclusion that should give some direction to future research in this area.\n",

      "Towards Integrated Digital-Twins: An Application Framework for Autonomous Maritime Surface Vessel Development\n",
      "The use of digital twins for the development of Autonomous Maritime Surface Vessels (AMSVs) has enormous potential to resolve the increasing need for water-based navigation and safety at the sea. Aiming at the problem of lack of broad and integrated digital twin implementations with live data along with the absence of a digital twin-driven framework for AMSV design and development, an application framework for the development of a fully autonomous vessel using an integrated digital twin in a 3D simulation environment has been presented. Our framework has 4 layers which ensure that simulation and real-world vessel and the environment are as close as possible. Åboat, an in-house, experimental research platform for maritime automation and autonomous surface vessel applications, equipped with two trolling electric motors, cameras, LiDARs, IMU and GPS has been used as the case study to provide a proof of concept. Åboat, its sensors, and the environment have been replicated in a commercial, 3D simulation environment, AILiveSim. Using the proposed application framework, we develop obstacle detection and path planning systems based on machine learning which leverage live data from a 3D simulation environment to mirror the complex dynamics of the real world. Exploiting the proposed application framework, the rewards across training episodes of a Deep Reinforcement Learning model are evaluated for live simulated data in AILiveSim.\n",

      "Taking Control of the Digital Twin\n",
      "The rise of digital documentation has given the marine industry the ability to capture more information than ever about the ships and facilities we produce and operate. While this should make management of these assets more effective, the ease in which information can be created often means that we find ourselves unable to find the information we're searching for. As constituent engineering systems become more complex, integrated and autonomous the need to retain documentation that describes operation becomes necessary for efficient maintenance and resolving unforeseen situations. Digital Twin's address this challenge by retaining and publishing documentation, but a key principle is the efficient means to find data to ensure relevance and reduced searching time.\n",
      "\n",
      "For several years, AVEVA has been exploiting the opportunity to link asset documentation together using contextual themes to create a connected dataset which allows quick identification of critical and related information. This has resulted in several Digital Twin interfaces that deploy information into different scenarios and devices, from handheld personal devices to large format screens for team decision support. Using these tools our customers can maintain their vessel, expose trends in data and provide insight into ways their asset may be changing over time.\n",

      "Machine learning enhancement of manoeuvring prediction for ship Digital Twin using full-scale recordings\n",
      "Digital Twins have much attention in the shipping industry, attempting to support all phases of a vessel’s life cycle. With several tools appearing in Digital Twin software suites, high-quality manoeuvring and performance prediction remain cornerstones. Propulsion efficiency is in focus while in service. Simulator-based training is in focus to ensure safety of manoeuvring in confined waters and harbours. Prediction of ships’ velocity and turn rate are essential for correct look and feel during training, but phenomena like dynamic inflow to propellers, bank and shallow water effects limit simulators’ accuracy, and master mariners often comment that simulations could be in better agreement with actual behaviours of their vessel. This paper focuses on digital twin enhancements to better match reality. Using data logged during in-service operation, we first consider a system identification perspective, employing a first-principles model structure. Showing that a complete first-principles model is not identifiable under the excitation met in service, we employ a Recurrent Neural Network to predict deviations between measured velocities and the model output. The outcome is a hybrid of a first-principles model with a machine learning generic approximator add-on. The paper demonstrates significant improvements in prediction accuracy of both in-harbour manoeuvring and shallow water passage conditions.\n",

      "The International Maritime Organization is establishing international agreements on maritime safety and security to prepare for the introduction of autonomous ships. In Korea, the industry is focusing on autonomous navigation system technology development, and to reduce accidents involving coastal ships, research on autonomous ship technology application plans for coastal ships is in progress. Interest in autonomously operated ships is increasing worldwide, and maritime demonstrations for verification of developed technologies are being pursued. In this study, a basic investigation was conducted on the design of a demonstration ship and an onshore platform (remote support center) using digital twin technology for application to coastal ships. To apply digital twin technology, an 8-m small battery-powered electric propulsion ship was selected as the target. The basic design of the twin-integrated platform was developed. The ship navigation and operation data were stored on a server system, and remote-control commands of the electric propulsion ship was achieved through communication between the ship and the onshore platform. Ship performance management, operation and operation optimization, and predictive control are possible using this digital twin technology. This safe and economical digital twin technology is applicable to ships responding to crisis scenarios.\n",

      "Developing a Digital Twin and Digital Thread Framework for an ‘Industry 4.0’ Shipyard\n",
      "This paper provides an overview of the current state-of-the-art digital twin and digital thread technology in industrial operations. Both are transformational technologies that have the advantage of improving the efficiency of current design and manufacturing. Digital twin is an important element of the Industry 4.0 digitalization process; however, the huge amount of data that are generated and collected by a digital twin offer challenges in handling, processing and storage. The paper aims to report on the development of a new framework that combines the digital twin and digital thread for better data management in order to drive innovation, improve the production process and performance and ensure continuity and traceability of information. The digital twin/thread framework incorporates behavior simulation and physical control components, in which these two components rely on the connectivity between the twin and thread for information flow and exchange to drive innovation. The twin/thread framework encompasses specifications that include organizational architecture layout, security, user access, databases and hardware and software requirements. It is envisaged that the framework will be applicable to enhancing the optimization of operational processes and traceability of information in the physical world, especially in an Industry Shipyard 4.0.\n",

      "Systems engineering and digital twin: a vision for the future of cruise ships design, production and operations\n",
      "Cruise ships are among the most complex and demanding products of the shipbuilding industry. The very special “payload” and exclusive operational profile, i.e. passengers looking for leisure and entertainment, imply outstanding performances in terms of safety standards and customer satisfaction. Attention to environment is relevant as well, since these ships are used to operate in spectacular marine ecosystems. The need of European shipyards to continuously progress to preserve the market leadership requires a virtuous evolution of the ship design process projected on a life cycle perspective. In this regard Systems Engineering appears to be a robust and reliable paradigm, able to provide the necessary comprehensive view of the cruise ship system as a whole together with a systematic methodological framework that, among the other advantages, enables the active and constructive participation of all the involved stakeholders in the decision-making process. In particular, Systems Engineering strongly relies on the so-called model-based engineering to share, integrate, combine and improve the level of details relevant to the system under development. In this paper the digital twin model will be discussed as a natural evolution of above-mentioned model-based engineering and its utilization in the shipbuilding field will be described as a very promising application especially in the field of cruise ships.\n",

      "As the 4th industrial revolution progresses, the application of several cutting-edge technologies such as the Internet of Things, big data, and mixed reality (MR) in relation to autonomous ships is being considered in the maritime logistics field. The aim of this study was to apply the concept of a digital twin model based on Human Machine Interaction (HMI) including a digital twin model and the role of an operator to a ship. The role of the digital twin is divided into information provision, support, decision, and implementation. The role of the operator is divided into operation, decision-making, supervision, and standby. The system constituting the ship was investigated. The digital twin system that could be applied to the ship was also investigated. The cloud-based digital twin system architecture that could apply investigated applications was divided into ship data collection (part 1), cloud system (part 2), analysis system/application (part 3), and MR/mobile system (part 4). A Mixed Reality device HoloLens was used as an HMI equipment to perform a simulation test of a digital twin system of an 8 m battery-based electric propulsion ship.\n",

      "Rapid acquisition method for structural strength evaluation stresses of the ship digital twin model\n",
      "The existing ship hull structure stress monitoring can only give the stress state of typical measuring points, but the monitoring point may not be the most dangerous location of the ship hull structure. To solve this problem, this paper carried out the research of ship strength digital twin. Concretely, to meet the real-time requirements for obtaining the structural stress state, this paper proposed a rapid acquisition method for structural strength evaluation stresses of the ship digital twin model, which realizes the rapid acquisition for structural yield strength evaluation stresses at the monitoring point and the non-monitoring point. To illustrate the specific application and application effect of the proposed method, the amidships three compartments section of a 21,000TEU ultra-large container ship was selected as the research object. And the case that this research object may suffer from the vertical wave bending moment and the horizontal wave bending moment simultaneously was considered. Related studies show that the proposed method can accurately recognize the load actually suffered by the ship monitoring structure. And the specific meaning of the ship monitoring structure referred to here is the ship hull structure that requires structural stress state monitoring. At the same time, related studies also show that the maximum error of the calculation results obtained by the proposed method does not exceed 0.0005% in obtaining the structural yield strength evaluation stress at the monitoring point, while the maximum calculation error does not exceed 0.032% in obtaining the structural yield strength evaluation stress at the non-monitoring point.\n",

      "A digital twin approach for maritime carbon intensity evaluation accounting for operational and environmental uncertainty\n",
      "Maritime industry has set ambitious goals to drastically reduce its greenhouse gas emissions through stipulating and enforcing a number of energy assessment measures. Unfortunately, measures like the EEDI, EEXI, SEEMP and CII do not account for the operational and environmental uncertainty of operations at sea, even though they do provide a first means of evaluating the carbon footprint of ships. The increasing availability of high-frequency operational data offers the opportunity to quantify and account for this uncertainty in energy performance predictions. Current methods to evaluate and predict energy performance at a whole energy system level do not sufficiently account for operational and environmental uncertainty. In this work, we propose a digital twin that accurately predicts the fuel consumption and carbon footprint of the hybrid propulsion system of an Ocean-going Patrol Vessel (OPV) of the Royal Netherlands Navy under the aggregate effect of operational and environmental uncertainty. It combines first-principle steady-state models with machine learning algorithms to reach an accuracy of less than 5% MAPE on both mechanical and electrical propulsion, while bringing a 40% to 50% improvement over a model that does not utilise machine learning algorithms. Results over actual voyage intervals indicate a prediction accuracy of consumed fuel and carbon intensity within 2.5% accounting for a confidence interval of 95%. Finally, the direct comparison between mechanical and electrical propulsion showed no clear energy-saving benefits and a strong dependency of the results on each voyage’s specific operational and environmental conditions.\n",

      "Sustainability and environmental compliance in ship operations is a prominent research topic as the waterborne sector is obliged to adopt ”green” mitigation strategies towards a low emissions operational blueprint. Fuel-Oil-Consumption (FOC) estimation, constitutes one of the key components in maritime transport information systems for efficiency and environmental compliance.

      "On application of digital twin in ship operation and performance\n",
      "Shipping is a growing industry and is today responsible for over 90% of world trade. Tight schedules while in port and long travelling distances are common aspects of transportation, and hence efficiency is very important to maintain maximum profit. One of the most important factors to maintain profitability is to reduce operational downtime. Methods for predicting these events can be developed to prevent unwanted repairs and shutdowns. Condition monitoring is a strategy which involves monitoring the condition of physical components located on e.g. a vessel. If irregularities in vibration data or temperature are discovered, condition-based maintenance can be performed on the relevant components before the failure happens. This reduces the maintenance cost as well as increases operational up-time. To predict future failures, three different modelling methods are typically used. Data-driven modelling uses datasets and machine learning technology to develop a model by either using classification or regression algorithms. Physics-based modelling is a mathematical representation of an asset which uses common physical characteristics to simulate its behaviour. An approach combining these two condition-based methods is called hybrid modelling. A model gathering real-time data for monitoring the condition of a physical asset is called a Digital Twin. A Digital Twin is a digital representation of an object. This technology is gradually getting more attention within several industries. In this thesis, a data-driven model is developed to predict fuel oil consumption per day for marine vessels, which directly correlates to the power output, a relevant parameter in the context of machinery conditions. Several regression models have been trained based on data from four of Gearbulk's vessels. Data from a fifth vessel has been used as test data to validate the accuracy of the model. A ranking of the ten best algorithms showed a low RMSE for both the training and test dataset. The results showed a clear correlation between fuel oil consumption per day and the predictor parameters. The accuracy was higher on the test dataset which indicates a potential overfitted model. This can however be solved by adjusting the data handling and training method. The use of condition monitoring systems and digital twins are increasing in popularity within the maritime industry, but the technology is not yet flawless. It is important to understand how the technology works before it is implemented to maximise its potential.\n",

      "A digital twin framework for real-time ship routing considering decarbonization regulatory compliance\n",
      "International Marine Organization is promoting stricter carbon emission reduction targets, and the influx of environmental regulations presents compliance risks for maritime sector. Stakeholders need to take decarbonization performance indicators into account in ship routing to maintain regulatory compliance. To meet decarbonization goals, a decision support method related to environmental regulatory compliance is necessary for voyage optimization. To this end, this paper presents a digital twin-enabled framework for real-time decarbonization regulatory compliance prognosis in ship routing. The proposed framework tracks real-time carbon intensity and identifies opportunities for reducing operational risks associated with decarbonization goals. The digital twin approach leverage real-time environmental and operational data for improved estimation of vessel-specific regulatory compliance probability along the voyage. An improved dynamic programming algorithm is used for ship routing. The presented framework is versatile in dealing with various decarbonization regulations to provide routing decision support. An illustrated case of a container ship sailing across the South China sea is presented to demonstrate the applicability of the framework.\n",

      "Reshaping Digital Twin in Technology Developments for Enhancing Marine Systems Design\n",
      "The digital twin technology platform has not yet achieved the expected acceptance and wider implementation in the maritime industry. So far, most of the focus of the digital twin application discussions have centred around what to learn from big data in ship operation, and to a lesser extent, has anybody extended this discussion to include the benefits such new technology can contribute to the enhancement of the upstream ship concept and basic design activities, as well as detailed engineering. This paper particularly pays attention to this latter, partly forgotten, application area. There could be many reasons behind such a reluctance to take on new technology and utilize it to its full potential. It is hypothesized and argued by this article that the development has focused on applications that are too complex, too expensive and reflect, to a little extent, real-life needs. Lack of effective data transfer and transaction interphases among relevant stakeholders is another important factor creating these inefficiencies.  This paper document how and why such inefficiencies in novel digitization technology adoption and adaptation exist and hamper the progress of achieving noticeable benefits of such implementations and how such development hurdles can be eliminated.\n",
      "\n",
      "Real-life user cases and several contributions in the professional literature suggest that more effective implementation of digital twin technology requires further discussions and investigations relating to three important aspects: i) a common and accepted definition of what is a digital twin; ii) an agreed-upon scalable and systemic approach to what is the solution space for a digital twin solution and iii) which systemic method to be used for digital twin development. Digital-twin technology must combine effective ship in operation and ship design feedback and feed forwarding, including their inherent people involvement and market behaviour.  This article reviews the status of digital twin technology in the maritime domain and proposes a common definition of the digital twin. The latter part of the article proposes a systemic perspective for effective digital twin development and a method for a goal-oriented digital twin development in the novel ship design domain as well for ships in operations.

      "There is a difference between the monitoring range of the sensor and the range required by the strength evaluation of ship hull structure, where the specific meaning of the range here is the length. At the same time, there may also be a difference in the stress form between the stress monitoring data obtained from the sensor and the structural stress data used for the strength evaluation of ship hull structure. As a result, one cannot apply the stress monitoring data directly to the strength evaluation of the digital twin model for the ship monitoring structure. To solve the above problem, this paper proposed a local stress correlation method, which can be used to obtain the structural stress data suitable for the specific strength evaluation of the digital twin model for the ship monitoring structure from stress monitoring data. In particular, a 21,000TEU ultra-large container ship was chosen as the targeted ship in this paper, and attention was paid to its yield stress state. Related studies have verified the feasibility of the local stress correlation method proposed in this paper. And related studies also indicate that the local stress correlation method can accurately obtain the evaluation stress for the digital twin model of the ship monitoring structure. And thus, the misjudgment of the real stress state for ship monitoring structure caused by the direct application of the stress monitoring data can be effectively avoided.\n",

One of the concepts making use of such opportunities is the digital twin, a comprehensive simulation of an engineering system that receives updated data from that system to mirror and predict its behaviour. In the ship domain, development of comprehensive digital twins finds obstacles in the lack of interoperability among digital tools and their formats. This thesis investigates use of standards to model digital twin ships with the aim of enabling data exchanges among systems, i.e., a standards-based approach.\n",
      "The work begins by investigating challenges to digital twin standardisation from the perspective of previous initiatives in the ship industry, comparisons with other sectors, and emerging trends. A few drivers are identified to guide future standardisation attempts: pragmatism in scope, support to heterogeneous systems, openness, and intelligibility. Following from these drivers, the study identifies existing standards covering the domains of ship visualisation, sensor logs, and taxonomies for ship data. They are applied to develop a web-based digital twin of an experiment in a wave basin, taking advantage of the broad support offered to web standards. The case study delimits standardisation gaps in the domains of ship models, with its accompanying metadata, and simulation of ship behaviour in operation. Both of them are taken as motivation for following research stages. The first topic is addressed by extending the open source Vessel.js library, originally developed for conceptual ship design, to handle detailed vessel models suitable for digital twins. This is done with a flexible framework which allows mapping of digital twin data to existing ship taxonomies during both design and operation. The framework is applied to a case study with a research vessel, demonstrating advantages and uncovering obstacles to scaling. The second topic is partially handled through development of functionalities for simulation and visualisation of wave motion response in Vessel.js. The library is used to develop several responsive, real-time applications combining simpler models executed on the browser and results from complex analyses, executed with external software.\n",

      "Data Driven Digital Twin Applications Towards Green Ship Operations\n",
      "Due to the growing rate of energy consumption and its consequent emissions, the International Maritime Organization (IMO) has devised strict rules for an extensive reduction in Greenhouse Emissions (GHG), which forces the shipping industry to search for more energy-efficient solutions. Therefore, alongside with the Energy Efficiency Design Index (EEDI), improving the energy efficiency of existing ships under the Energy Efficiency Existing Ship Index (EEXI) is of considerable importance. This paper address this issue by proposing a digital twin framework supported by big data analytics for ship performance monitoring. The proposed framework is developed by the respective data sets from a selected vessel. For this purpose, a cluster analysis is implemented using the Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs) with the Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm. By this approach, the most frequent operating regions of the engine is detected, the shapes of these frequent operating regions are captured, and the relationships between different navigation and performance parameters of the engine are determined. That will make the basis for a digital twin application in shipping. The main objective of this research study is to develop a digital twin of a marine engine by considering the engine operational conditions that can be utilized toward green ship operations. The contribution of this paper and the outcomes can facilitate the shipping industry to meet the IMO requirements enforced by its regulations.\n",

      "Digital Twin-Driven Approach for Process Management and Traceability towards Ship Industry\n",
      "The digital twin (DT) approach has risen in popularity for applications in many industrial process managements. By applying the “Shipyard 4.0” digital transformation trend, the ship industry is developing techniques able to reduce risks by improving operation process management. This study proposes a combination of a DT approach and practical experiment as part of a five-tier framework for DT-driven process management in the ship industry. This study focuses on the characteristic scenarios and crucial parameters within the ship engine system and shipping cargo container in operation procedures. DT-based models and platforms are established in this study based on the basic modeling of Maya and scene rendering of Unity 3D. To address the fusion issue of multi-source heterogeneous data in the ship operation process, a Bayesian neural network (BNN) method is introduced into DT’s virtual model layer and data support layer. By integrating an improved BNN-based algorithm into DT-based models, the collected data can be extracted and aggregated accordingly. In the ship engine room, the operating temperature is selected as a critical parameter, with the best mean percentage deviation (MPD) between DT-driven predictions and test value of 3.18%. During the shipping cargo container process, the results indicate that DT-based models have acceptable performances under different conditions, with optimal MPDs of 5.22%.\n",

      "Using digital twins in voyage performance evaluation is becoming critical for ocean vessels to reduce GHG emissions. A novel GBM approach is proposed in this paper to establish a digital twin model for voyage performance prediction. The weather hindcast data are introduced to enrich noon reports (NR) and automatic identification system (AIS) datasets, which are split into training and validation sets to develop GBM. The NR and AIS datasets collected from a 57000DWT bulk carrier are used to demonstrate the fidelity and capability of the proposed GBM. The voyage performance prediction from the GBM shows better accuracy than those from pure WBM or pure BBMs. An arrival time forecast and a weather routing showcase are also presented to demonstrate the application effects of GBM. The proposed GBM provides a satisfying prediction of ship speed and fuel consumption without mandatory sensor-collected data, thus applicable for a varity of vessels. In those cases where more sensors are available onboard, the proposed approach can incorporate sensor data to improve the model accuracy further.\n",

The model is an end-to-end simulation of a ship from prime mover to maneuvering, seakeeping, and propeller ventilation in random waves representing the behavior of a physical ship. There is a trend towards increasingly networked sensors and actuators to enable condition monitoring, ensure efficient operation, and allow for autonomy. However, a cyberattack on a networked control system presents not just the possibility of information theft but of physical system damage and loss of control. Thus, a detection scheme is proposed for cyber-physical systems using a joint unscented Kalman filter. It is employed to detect cyberattacks in the simulation model of an electric ship including sensor attacks and controller attacks on a gas turbine, synchronous generator, and automatic heading control. Finally, a system theoretic framework is presented for optimal sensor placement to minimize cyber vulnerability.\n",

      "The beginning of this decade finds artificial intelligence, high performance computing (HPC), and big data analytics in the forefront of digital transformation that is projected to heavily impact various industries and domains. Among those, the maritime industry has the potential to overcome many shortcomings and challenges through innovative technical solutions that combine the aforementioned innovative technologies. Naval vessels and shipping in general, generate extremely large amounts of data, the potential of which remains largely untapped due to the limitations of current systems. Simultaneously, digital twins can be used for conducting complex simulations of vessels and their systems to improve efficiency, automate, and evaluate current and future performance. However, they require large amounts of real-time and historical data to simulate efficiently, as well as AI models and high-performance computing that will help the entire system run smoothly and be scalable to higher volumes of data and computation requirements. Integrating these technologies and tools in a unified system poses various challenges. Under this context, the current publication presents the high-level conceptual architecture of VesselAI, an EU-funded project that aims to develop, validate and demonstrate a novel holistic framework based on a combination of the state-of-the-art HPC, Big Data and AI technologies, capable of performing extreme-scale and distributed analytics for fuelling the next-generation digital twins in maritime applications and beyond, including vessel motion and behaviour modelling, analysis and prediction, ship energy system design and optimisation, unmanned vessels, route optimisation and fleet intelligence.\n",

      "This paper presents some aspects of the risk and challenges associated with digital twin implementation in the marine industry by learning from the aviation industry where the digital twin is more widely employed. The digital twin applications in aviation and marine industries are presented and the main steps of developing a digital twin are discussed. The three main steps of sensors (measurements), model, and data analysis are identified and used in the study. The lessons from two recent accidents in the aviation industry (Boeing 737 MAX crashes in Indonesia and Ethiopia in 2018 and 2019) are studied in details and discussed. It was found that the sensor reliability, model failure and wrong decisions as the output of the data processing are among the risks associated with digital twin implementations. In particular, from the case study accidents, it was found that the digital twin may not be able to represent all the possible scenarios which a system may experience in its life time. The digital twin presents many advantages, however the implementation of the digital twin is associated with risk and high uncertainties, even in the industries like the aviation industry, where the digital twin is well established and at a higher advanced level than in the marine industry.\n",

      "Towards a digital twin approach for vessel-specific fatigue damage monitoring and prognosis\n",
      "This paper proposes a Digital Twin approach for the monitoring and prognosis of vessel-specific fatigue damage. During design, fatigue damage estimates are based on conservative assumptions regarding operational conditions and structural response. However, variability in the vessel-specific operations from those assumed during design needs to be considered when supporting engineering-based decisions for maintenance deferrals and service life extensions. The use of Digital Twins is proposed to provide this necessary vessel-specific decision support. Digital Twins typically rely on sensor-based data to update their models, however structural health sensors for fatigue monitoring can be prohibitively expensive to install and maintain in ship structures, so the proposed method addresses this by instead combining publicly available vessel-specific operational data (global vessel position data coupled with metocean hindcast data) with computational models to monitor the environmental exposure and track the vessel fatigue accumulation over time. This approach is demonstrated through a case study of a containership that has been in operation for seven years. The results of proposed approach are compared against the fatigue estimate obtained using the design reference wave conditions. The Digital Twin is then used to forecast the remaining fatigue life, in order to support inspection and maintenance scheduling and operational decision-making.\n",

      "Data Driven Digital Twins for the Maritime Domain\n",
      "Digital twins are computational models that replicate the structure, behaviour and overall characteristics of a physical asset in the digital world. In the maritime domain, conventional approaches have relied on mathematical modeling (e.g., linearised equations of motion) and heavy computations for estimating ship resistance and propulsion, seakeeping and maneuverability and overall hull form optimization, treating the vessel as a point body. For instance, the ability to predict a vessel’s future track in confined or congested waters presents a significant challenge due to the fact that as time passes, these models often fall out of sync with their digital counterparts due to changes that happen to the ship (e.g., foulding affecting maneuverability). In addition to this, mostly due to computational resources required, in real world deployments models are simplified, thus reducing their overall prediction accuracy. In our work, we implement AI-enabled coupled abstractions of the asset-twin system, which rely on machine learning methods for constant learning of the evolving over time behavior of a vessel based on historical trip data and information related to vessel’s structure and loading capacity. The evaluation results indicate that the inclusion of vessel and journey specific information is beneficial for the predictions.\n",

      "Integrated Ship Energy Flowchart: A digital twin to mitigate GHG emissions\n",
      "The alarming rate of climate change accentuates the need to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions produced from anthropogenic activities and consequently the consumption of fossil fuels. The transportation sector is one of the most energy-demanding activities, consisting around 27% of the global primary energy demand and one of the major contributors of GHG emissions to the atmosphere, while shipping transportation accounts for nearly 12% of its CO2 emissions. Decarbonization is vital for emission mitigation using innovative technologies, policies, and incentives at a local and international level. In this context, the presented Integrated Ship Energy Flowchart (ISEF), aims to create a digital twin of a ship and carry out deterministic calculations, such as engine power requirements and by extension fuel consumption and emissions, by modelling the various components of a ship’s energy flow. Most modeling approaches depend on tracking data from automatic identification systems (AIS) and commercial vessel databases, accompanied with prohibitive costs for many, as well as missing vessel characteristics. ISEF, on the other hand, aims to fill in the gap in case of missing or costly to obtain data while maintaining the flexibility to utilize field data if available. This is done by providing representative vessel characteristics, detailed engine modeling and simulating components such as environmental conditions (sea-state, wind). At the same time, ISEF develops a library of vessel data including ship particulars, engine and route information among others. Thus, it is also suitable for the validation of tracking information and machine learning or other deterministic algorithms. Additionally, this library will enable the development of a statistically representative ship describing the international fleet. This will therefore improve projection algorithms utilized in calculations and aid the evaluation of mitigation options regarding decarbonisation in terms of the overall fleet. Such a model also enables the investigation of alternative fuels and fuel mixtures, route optimization, and inclusion of cold ironing amongst others. The current objectives include the validation of the core modelling implementation via comparisons with available raw data to serve as a reference case and build the necessary libraries. Therefore, a case study of a specific ship utilizing real navigational data will be used to demonstrate the capabilities of the algorithm.\n",

      "Numerous ports worldwide are adopting automation to boost productivity and modernize their operations. At this point, smart ports become a more important paradigm for handling increasing cargo volumes and increasing operational efficiency. In fact, as ports become more congested and cargo volumes increase, the need for accurate navigation through seaports is more pronounced to avoid collisions and the resulting consequences. To this end, digital twin (DT) technology in the fifth-generation (5G) networks and drone-assisted data collection can be combined to provide precise ship maneuvering. In this paper, we propose a DT model using drone-assisted data collection architecture, called TwinPort, to offer a comprehensive port management system for smart seaports.

The proposed DSS assesses the resilience of a port under possible disruptive events given its design, operations and potential pre-defined post-event recovery actions to mitigate the impact of the disruption. Digital twinning provides the fidelity required to realistically predict port performance with taken post-event recovery actions under various possible disruptive events. In addition to hedging against impacts from probabilistically known disruption events, this approach also enables inclusion of ordinary operational uncertainties within the resilience evaluation. This is not generally feasible with other existing resilience quantification approaches. To tackle computational challenges of applying a digital twin for real-world size applications, an optimal computing budget allocation policy is adopted to improve computational efficiency. Results of numerical experiments using a real-world size port demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed DSS and criticality of accounting for ordinary uncertainties in operations in resilience estimation.\n",

First, the predictive analytics problem is addressed by the finite-state method in the case of the shipyard’s fabrication line, and the obtained results are validated afterward using a numerical model through discrete-event theory. The predictive analytics indicate an almost ideal balancing of the fabrication line, except for the buffers storing stiffeners before the coat-dying and marking operations.

      "A digital twin is the essential part of a recent and unavoidable trend in ship operation digitalisation. The digital twin is a virtual replica of real ship or a particular system that coexists with its physical counterpart and maps the dynamic behaviour in real-time. Thus, the digital twin combines physical space real-time data with a set of dynamic models representing the physical counterpart in the cyberspace. The problem of digital twin development is a trade-off between insight into the dynamic process and real-time execution constraint. This paper describes a modelling approach that combines continuous time-domain cycle-mean value engine model with the crank-angle resolved phenomenological combustion model, satisfying the real-time execution constraint. The set of conservation laws, notably energy and mass, supplemented with the phenomenological Wiebe combustion model, is treated in the integral form allowing transformation into a set of nonlinear algebraic equations. The solution of the resulting system exhibits fast speed and accuracy as compared with the traditional approach combining differential equations and Runge-Kutta solver.\n",

      "This paper presents a small-scale powertrain test bench, which was designed and built to simulate a maritime azimuth thruster. Down-scaled replicas enable studying large systems in a cost-effective and less laborious manner. The test bench was equipped with instrumentation able to research dynamic effects, loads and vibration acting in a real azimuth thruster. Two servomotors were used in each end of the powertrain. The other acted as the drive motor and the other was used to create excitations and load from the propeller side. Torsional vibration was detected by measuring the twist of the shafts and by utilizing torque transducers. Analysis of the measurement data indicated that the lowest resonance frequencies of the test bench were similar to full-scale thrusters. The revealed dynamic properties suggested by the measurement data enabled the test bench to be concluded as adequate for emulating the torsional dynamics of the full-scale thrusters. The built apparatus will be used for developing digital twins, physical (wired and wireless) and virtual sensors, and techniques for condition monitoring.\n",

      "The Need for Sufficiently Accurate Geometrical Representations of Ship Hull Forms for Digital Twins for Performance Prediction\n",
      "Operational performance optimization is a key element to reduce both fuel consumption and emissions and meet current and upcoming legislation, e.g., the EEXI, the CII and the European ETS. While technical innovation and improvements are important, the careful use of fuel on board plays a vital role to meet these targets. Here route and speed optimization are decisive. The basis of any approach to operational optimization is a digital twin which allows predicting the behavior of the ship and its energy consuming systems in a reliable and suitably accurate way. Here geometry plays an important role. The German R&D project MariData (maridata.org) addresses (present) shortcomings of onboard energy management systems. One specific element highlighted in this paper focuses on the desired quality of geometric representations for digital twins when used as a basis for performance analysis and improved energy consumption during operation. The paper compares different approaches and necessary levels of modeling fidelity to indicate attainable accuracy, aiming at further elucidating how good hydrodynamics need to be represented.\n",

      "In this work, a brief survey of simulation methods used to create digital twins (DTs) or assist DTs in the automotive, aviation, and marine industries is presented. The simulation methods are classified as model-driven, data-driven, and hybrid methods. In addition, simulation methods in these three industries are studied from the phases of design, manufacturing, and operation. The similarities, differences and characteristics of the simulation methods applied to the automotive, aviation and maritime industries are discussed and summarized from several aspects. Model-driven approaches are used more frequently than the other two methods in design and manufacturing phases, while hybrid methods have great potential to support different operations of DT-related studies in the reviewed three industries. In addition, issues of prognostics and health management (PHM) such as fault diagnosis, remaining useful life (RUL) has recently been more inclined to be studied using data-driven approaches. According to our analysis we believe that as DT technology evolves, the hybrid approach will become the mainstream strategy for DT-based modeling.\n",

      "Providing the best possible support to commissioning engineers is critical for efficient execution of commissioning and on-time delivery of a shipbuilding project. This paper contributes to current research on the digitization of maritime commissioning and builds on existing approaches to a digital twin. Based on an analysis of the execution process, this paper presents a human-centric digital assistance system that is designed to provide the commissioning engineers with an improved information supply and to increase situational awareness in the complex and error-prone ETO process. In addition, the system can be connected to the ship automation system via OPC UA to display, check, and document sensor values directly in the assistance system. Problems and rework items can be documented context-sensitively and with little effort and fed back into the digital twin. The automated documentation and continuous enrichment of the digital twin help reduce effort, make the commissioning process more transparent, and progress indications more resilient.

      "The new generation of artificial intelligence technology has improved the autonomous monitoring capabilities of marine equipment. The ocean monitoring platform based on edge computing realizes the autonomous collaboration of multi-agent equipment groups. Autonomous Underwater Glider (AUG) is a new type of energy-saving marine equipment that can realize long-range ocean exploration. However, the non-negligible power constraints, time delays, communication failures and other unfavorable factors in the special underwater working environment have brought great challenges to the underwater monitoring operations of multi-AUG systems. This research establishes an improved artificial potential field method scheme based on the Maritime Internet of Things, which is based on the AUG leader's edge device to control multi-AUGs. In this process, an improved artificial potential field method is designed to solve the local optimal problem through behavior-based path optimization. Then, multi-AUGs are controlled to adapt to the task team plan based on the edge computing of the AUG leader. From the experimental results, it effectively realizes the AUG group cooperative control in the leader mode. Meanwhile, we established a marine communication model and AUG physics engine control model to complete a digital twin of multi-AUG monitoring tasks.\n",

      "In this paper, full-scale data for two ships have been used for the comparison of five different added resistance methods. The effect of using separate wave spectra for wind waves and swell on performance prediction has been explored. The importance of the peak enhancement factor(γ) in the JONSWAP spectrum for added resistance computation has been studied. Simulation model including calm water resistance, added resistance and wind resistance has been used. Ships have been simulated in the same weather conditions and propeller speed as in the case of full-scale ships using different methods for added resistance. The performance of these methods has been quantified by comparing speed and power predictions with the full-scale data. The paper also discusses the challenges involved in using full-scale data for such a comparison because of difficulty in isolating the effect of added resistance in full-scale data.\n",

      "It was observed that three out of five methods were able to predict added resistance even in high waveheights. Even though these methods showed significantly different RAOs, its effect on speed and power prediction was minor. Simulation results were not sensitive to the choice of peak enhancement factor(γ) in the JONSWAP spectrum. There was minor improvement in results by using separate wave spectra for wind waves and swell instead of single wave spectrum for combined wind waves and swell.\n",

      "Port Digital Twin Development for Decarbonization: A Case Study Using the Pusan Newport International Terminal\n",
      "The maritime industry is a major carbon emission contributor. Therefore, the global maritime industry puts every effort into reducing carbon emissions in the shipping chain, which includes vessel fleets, ports, terminals, and hinterland transportation. A representative example is the carbon emission reduction standard mandated by the International Maritime Organization for international sailing ships to reduce carbon emissions this year. Among the decarbonization tools, the most immediate solution for reducing carbon emissions is to reduce vessel waiting time near ports and increase operational efficiency. The operation efficiency improvement in maritime stakeholders’ port operations can be achieved using data. This data collection and operational efficiency improvement can be realized using a digital twin. This study develops a digital twin that measures and reduces carbon emissions using the collaborative operation of maritime stakeholders. In this study, the authors propose a data structure and backbone scheduling algorithm for a port digital twin. The interactive scheduling between a port and its vessels is investigated using the digital twin. The digital twin’s interactive scheduling for the proposed model improved predictions of vessel arrival time and voyage carbon emissions. The result of the proposed digital twin model is compared to an actual operation case from the Busan New Port in September 2022, which shows that the proposed model saves over 75 % of the carbon emissions compared with the case.\n",

      "Concept design of a digital twin architecture for ship structural health management\n",
      "Ocean-going vessels frequently experience severe weather conditions. Occasionally, the actual environmental loads are much larger than design values, resulting in deviations from design conditions that may cause serious structural damage. A structural digital twin can enhance predictability and reliability of marine structures, and thus provide vessel operators, owners, and stakeholders with a more accurate overview of a vessel's condition. It can also help reduce lifecycle costs through proposing rational and optimal inspection, maintenance, repair programs, and assist on maximizing service life and mission availability. This paper uses a benchmark vessel to investigate structural behaviors of the vessel through dynamic loading approach. The correlation between structure members and critical responses are established, and high stress concentration areas have been identified. Subsequently, this paper develops a conceptual digital twin architecture. The proposed digital twin predicts responses of the entire structure to measured or predicted environmental conditions with a hybrid model combining numerical simulations with measurements. While the traditional structural monitoring system focuses on the health condition of typical hot spots, the proposed digital twin may improve structural health awareness of the entire hull structure based on a limited number of sensors.\n",

      "Applications of Digital Twin across Industries: A Review\n",
      "One of the most promising technologies that is driving digitalization in several industries is Digital Twin (DT). DT refers to the digital replica or model of any physical object (physical twin). What differentiates DT from simulation and other digital or CAD models is the automatic bidirectional exchange of data between digital and physical twins in real-time. The benefits of implementing DT in any sector include reduced operational costs and time, increased productivity, better decision making, improved predictive/preventive maintenance, etc. As a result, its implementation is expected to grow exponentially in the coming decades as, with the advent of Industry 4.0, products and systems have become more intelligent, relaying on collection and storing incremental amounts of data. Connecting that data effectively to DTs can open up many new opportunities and this paper explores different industrial sectors where the implementation of DT is taking advantage of these opportunities and how these opportunities are taking the industry forward. The paper covers the applications of DT in 13 different industries including the manufacturing, agriculture, education, construction, medicine, and retail, along with the industrial use case in these industries.\n",

      "Digital twins (DTs) are being increasingly considered in the maritime industry for the purposes of system design, monitoring, control, optimization, operational planning, maintenance, fault detection, and life cycle management. A system simulation can be utilized to enable many of these functionalities. Co-simulation based on the Functional Mock-up Interface (FMI) is typically used to interface component models independently developed in different modelling platforms, possibly having different supplier intellectual property restrictions. Currently, more than 170 software tools support FMI, a subset of which also support co-simulation. In this paper, a methodology for the selection of a co-simulation platform for a maritime DT is presented. The methodology is demonstrated for two maritime energy system case studies with different DT purposes and users, that represent different phases of a ship’s lifecycle. MATLAB/Simulink and Open Simulation Platform (OSP) are used as example co-simulation platforms. The DT’s purpose and its users are considered to understand the functional and interface requirements for a qualitative comparison of the platforms. Additionally, the platforms’ performance is compared quantitatively by co-simulating Functional Mock-up Units (FMUs) of the component models. The derived requirements, as well as the platforms’ capabilities and offerings, are then analyzed to select a suitable platform. It is shown that the choice of the co-simulation platform can be different according to the DT’s purpose, users, and phase of the ship’s and DT’s lifecycle.\n",

A digital twin is at its core a virtual representation of a physical asset, it can simulate the interaction of the diverse systems involved in the operation of its real-life counterpart and combine them with available sensor data. As such, a digital twin can accompany a vessel from its early stages of development, going then through the integration of additional systems, testing of new implementations, monitoring of the real vessel, and its maintenance.\n",

To this effect, a backend implementation has been developed for interfacing with the real-time data stream coming from Gunnerus. This backend will then be used to provide processed data to the applications in charge of vessel monitoring and decision support for safe navigation. These applications will be implemented as a 3D visualization based on the Autoferry Gemini simulator, and a 2D electronic chart web application, both conveying information related to Gunnerus and the surrounding vessels. Furthermore, the 2D electronic chart will display information regarding the decision support for safe navigation. This decision support system will use real-time data in order to display parameters from automatic radar plotting aids related to nearby vessels. Additionally, a safe trajectory based on control barrier functions will be displayed in the same chart as a suggestion for safe navigation for the officer on watch.\n",

The systems being twinned (e.g. defense, manufacturing, logistics, computer and network systems) are typically very complex and require significant effort to model and track. This paper discusses how Distributed Simulation (DS) can support DTs thanks to a network of distributed computing resources. DS can speed up the execution of simulation programs in DTs (and therefore the time taken to analyze the behavior of a system) and link together simulations to support composability and reusability during the development of DTs. A distributed real-time simulation environment based on the IEEE 1516 High Level Architecture Standard (HLA) has been developed in the case of the DT of an Underwater Unmanned Vehicles (UUV), intended to extend the ship capabilities. In this study, major Italian stakeholders, working in the maritime domain, are developing a number of tools and enabling technologies needed for the practical implementation of an extended ship with a fleet of underwater and surface drones and found in the HLA-based DS a perfect solution for a simulation-based DT.\n",

It allows analysis of data and monitoring of marine systems to avoid problems before they occur, and plan for the future by using simulations. However, issues related to integration of heterogeneous systems and hardware, memory, and CPU utilization makes implementing such a digital twin in a monolithic or centralized manner undesirable. Co-simulation addresses this problem, allowing different sub-systems to be modelled independently, but simulated together. This paper presents the ongoing work towards realizing a digital twin of the Gunnerus research vessel by applying co-simulation and related standards. The paper does not present a complete, ready-to-use digital twin. Rather it presents the preliminary results, procedure, and enabling technologies used towards realizing one. In order to accommodate this goal, a novel co-simulation solution, developed in cooperation by members of the Norwegian maritime industry, is presented. Furthermore, a maneuvering case-study is carried out, utilizing pre-recorded sensor data obtained from the Gunnerus. Through a comparative study with the real maneuver in terms of speed, course, and power consumption, the proposed approach is verified in simulation.\n",

      "Maritime industries desire high speed and reliability, low lifespan cost, and environmental impact shipping for transportation. Compared to highly congested land shipments and high-cost air freight, all-electric ship (AES) can reduce the lifespan energy consumption and transport a considerable freight volume at a lower rate. Recently, the medium voltage dc (MVDC) topology, recommended by IEEE standard, pushes the AES to the next stage in considering space and weight constraints with the reduction of bulky transformers and simplified parallel connections. However, device-level modeling of this massive parallel MVDC-based ship-board microgrid (SBM) is challenging to both the state-of-the-art general-purpose compute unit and traditional electromagnetic transient (EMT)-based emulation. With the rapid development of machine learning (ML) algorithm and its dedicated execution unit, accelerated parallel emulation becomes achievable in different levels of this paralleled connected SBM. Applying the ML-aided technique can help to improve the emulation execution efficiency and reduce the consumption of hardware resource on the field-programmable gate arrays. This work proposes a real-time hybrid ML-EMT-based digital twin of the complete SBM at the subsystem-level and equipment-level with validated results from PSCAD/EMTDC, and device-level with validated results from SaberRD.\n",

We also underline the importance of interoperability, data privacy and security, real-time synchronization, and accuracy and fidelity in the standardization of DTs. Unveiling the intricacies of the “correspondence measure,” we elucidate its potential in enhancing the standardization process by providing a standardized measure of the accuracy and reliability of a digital twin concerning its physical counterpart. Furthermore, we discuss the applications of our proposed method in various sectors such as manufacturing, healthcare, aerospace, maritime and shipping, and city management. Our findings suggest that the “correspondence measure” can significantly contribute to the existing standardization approaches by facilitating a better understanding of the DT's behavior, thereby fostering trust in these digital replications.

      "Condition monitoring (CM) of ship hull structures is a promising field that has recently attracted the interested of researches. The main challenge behind CM is to develop a system that gets as input sensor readings from the structure and provide the damage locus as an output. In this regard, the current study proposes two alternative CM digital twin schemes for solving this inverse engineering problem. The first one is based on a Finite Element (FE) – Optimization cooperative framework that solves several times the model until the predicted strains match the measured ones and as such the damage location has been found. The other scheme is based on a cooperative framework of Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) used for classification and fitting, that may be regarded as surrogated models which provide solutions instantaneously. The ANNs are trained through the numerical solutions provided by the FE model. A thin-walled hollow cantilever beam, that resembles a hull-girder subjected to principal stresses under vertical bending, has been adopted. The performed work has allowed for the selection and evaluation of the locations for sensor placement and the estimation of the damage sensitive area for monitoring. Both CM digital twin schemes have proven to be promising for the theoretical simplified examined case.\n",

      "The particularity of the marine underwater environment has brought many challenges to the development of underwater sensor networks (UWSNs). This research realized the effective monitoring of targets by UWSNs and achieved higher quality of service in various applications such as communication, monitoring, and data transmission in the marine environment. After analysis of the architecture, the marine integrated communication network system (MICN system) is constructed based on the maritime wireless Mesh network (MWMN) by combining with the UWSNs. A distributed hybrid fish swarm optimization algorithm (FSOA) based on mobility of underwater environment and artificial fish swarm (AFS) theory is proposed in response to the actual needs of UWSNs. The proposed FSOA algorithm makes full use of the perceptual communication of sensor nodes and lets the sensor nodes share the information covered by each other as much as possible, enhancing the global search ability. In addition, a reliable transmission protocol NC-HARQ is put forward based on the combination of network coding (NC) and hybrid automatic repeat request (HARQ). In this work, three sets of experiments are performed in an area of 200 × 200 × 200 m. The simulation results show that the FSOA algorithm can fully cover the events, effectively avoid the blind movement of nodes, and ensure consistent distribution density of nodes and events. The NC-HARQ protocol proposed uses relay nodes for retransmission, and the probability of successful retransmission is much higher than that of the source node. At a distance of more than 2,000 m, the successful delivery rate of data packets is as high as 99.6%. Based on the MICN system, the intelligent ship constructed with the digital twins framework can provide effective ship operating state prediction information. In summary, this study is of great value for improving the overall performance of UWSNs and advancing the monitoring of marine data information.\n",

      "Maritime industry is experiencing the influence of industry 4.0 solutions and investments. A commercial ship is comparable to an industrial plant and several analogies can be found between the two worlds. Digital twins represent the convergence of the engineering and the digital information technology worlds into the so-called cyber-physical systems, which promise to solve problems in the virtual world, based on the real-world data collected online, and then processed through simulation models and artificial intelligence. Although there is some research literature referring to digital twin (DT) solutions for specific problems in shipping, general lack of clarity on the level and direction of progress in this field has been observed by researchers. This paper tries to address exactly this question by collecting data using an opinion survey of managers of some maritime industry companies based in Greece – a country where a significant part of the global commercial fleet is being managed from. Drivers, enablers and impediments to the adoption of DT in shipping have been identified by an opinion survey. A first attempt to devise a generic cost-benefit framework for the adoption of DT solutions in shipping is presented as a key managerial decision-making tool for such a big investment needed for DT.\n",

They aim to create a continuously synchronized model of the physical system which enables rapid adaptation to dynamics, mainly unpredicted and undesirable changes. A wide range of industrial fields have already benefited from digital twins technology such as aerospace, manufacturing, healthcare, city management and maritime and shipping. Furthermore, recent research works are starting to study the integration of digital twins for computer networks to allow more innovation and intelligent management. One of the basic building blocks of digital twins technology is the Internet of Things where wireless sensors and actuators are deployed to ensure the interaction between the physical and digital worlds. This type of network is complex to manage due to its severe constraints especially when it controls critical industrial applications, resulting in the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT). We believe that the optimization of the IIoT will lead to efficient integration of Digital Twins in Industry 4.0. In this paper, we design a Network Digital Twin for the IIoT where sensors, actuators and communication infrastructure are replicated in the digital twin to enable intelligent real-time management of such networks. This way, new networking services such as predictive maintenance, network diagnosis, resource allocation, energy optimization with other intelligent services can be efficiently integrated and exploited in the network life-cycle.

A framework for visualisation and development of a digital twin and RL algorithms is developed in Unity Game Engine. A digital representation of the Trondheim Fjord terrain is created, where wind and rain is implemented by using real-time real world values for the area. Boats emitting AIS signals in the area are also used to create digital representations of the ships. Virtual Reality was implemented in the project which allows for both normal windowed visualisation and virtual visualisation. In addition, the Milliampere 2 boat is represented accurately in the project as a virtual object dictated by a flexible dynamical model. This dynamical model is affected by external forces like wind and two thrusters attached to the bottom of the vessel. As the real boat should have a LIDAR, a ray casting sensor array is used in the project to mimic its real counterpart. A pooling algorithm for the sensor readings is used to reduce the dimensions in the sensor from 220 to 9. This is used in an RL algorithm for controlling the\n",
      "boat.\n",
      "A RL algorithm using PPO is trained inside of Unity, where the goal is to follow a given path as closely as possible while avoiding obstacles like land and other boats. After RL training, the boat was given over 100 attempts to complete four paths of varying degree of difficulty. The boat had a 100% success rate on both of the paths containing no obstacles. This success rate dropped to 17% when obstacles were introduced. While the success rate was low when obstacles were introduced, it is suggested that minor changes in Unity will improve future training. A safety filter could be an good addition to ensure the RL model will not act dangerously.\n",

      "Sensor Control in Anti-Submarine Warfare—A Digital Twin and Random Finite Sets Based Approach\n",
      "Abstract\n",
      "Since the submarine has become the major threat to maritime security, there is an urgent need to find a more efficient method of anti-submarine warfare (ASW). The digital twin theory is one of the most outstanding information technologies, and has been quite popular in recent years. The most influential change produced by digital twin is the ability to enable real-time dynamic interactions between the simulation world and the real world. Digital twin can be regarded as a paradigm by means of which selected online measurements are dynamically assimilated into the simulation world, with the running simulation model guiding the real world adaptively in reverse. By combining digital twin theory and random finite sets (RFSs) closely, a new framework of sensor control in ASW is proposed. Two key algorithms are proposed for supporting the digital twin-based framework. First, the RFS-based data-assimilation algorithm is proposed for online assimilating the sequence of real-time measurements with detection uncertainty, data association uncertainty, noise, and clutters. Second, the computation of the reward function by using the results of the proposed data-assimilation algorithm is introduced to find the optimal control action. The results of three groups of experiments successfully verify the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed approach.\n",

      "Towards a Digital Twin of a Complex Maritime Site for Multi-Objective Optimization\n",
      "Her Majesty’s Naval Base (HMNB) Devonport is a complex maritime site in Plymouth, United Kingdom (UK). Using digital twin technology, the authors will model and simulate the physical entity of the dockyard to optimize for a set of critical priorities. Digital twins are virtual representations of a physical entity, such as a vehicle. They can fully model a complex environment, accurately modelling individual layers within the entity, with each layer accessing data required from other layers. This results in an accurate simulation so that when changes are made in one layer of the model, the impact across the other layers may be observed. An end-user could interact with this digital twin to understand how changing input parameters would affect the measured outputs, allowing the end-users to simulate different options and compare the simulated outcomes before deciding a course of action. If the digital twin is of higher fidelity, the simulated outcomes would be more accurate and demonstrate potentially unintended effects allowing for a more comprehensive overview for the decision-maker. From this digital twin, a decision-maker can manually identify the best parameters to simulate the outcomes through the digital twin. However, using multi-objective optimization can reduce this process so that the twin can create the inputs, monitor the outcomes, and repeatedly try to produce a specific number of outcomes to choose from. These outcomes would be based on a few priorities initially set, and the optimizer would change inputs to enhance each of these priorities. At HMNB Devonport, three main priorities have been identified: cost reduction, time efficiency and carbon neutrality.\n",

      "The digital twin can reconstruct the scenes of real traffic operation of inland waterways in virtual space, giving birth to new ideas for the digital transformation and upgrading of water safety management. Aiming at the problems of video fragmentation, sub-system data separation and untimely emergency response in the current inland waterway safety monitoring, this paper proposes a new method for reconstructing and applying a digital twin of inland waterways based on 3D video fusion which consists of four parts: (1) Combining drone tilt photography and BIM modeling technology to construct a three-dimensional scene model of inland waterways; (2) Proposing a multi-channel video three-dimensional registration and rendering method to integrate in real time discrete surveillance videos of different angles of view with three-dimensional scene model to establish the spatial correlation between different video images in the scene; (3) Integrating multi-source IoT sensing data to form a scene of digital twin of inland waterways; (4) Exploring innovative application methods for water safety management based on digital twins to meet the water safety management requirements and business logic of inland waterways. A certain segment of the Changhu Shen Line was selected for demonstration and application. The application results show that the construction and application of digital twins for inland waterways combined with 3D video reduces the pressure on managers to understand real-time video footage and improves the efficiency of daily monitoring, evidence collection, and emergency response.\n",

      "Digital Twin in the IoT Context: A Survey on Technical Features, Scenarios, and Architectural Models\n",
      "Digital twin (DT) is an emerging concept that is gaining attention in various industries. It refers to the ability to clone a physical object (PO) into a software counterpart. The softwarized object, termed logical object, reflects all the important properties and characteristics of the original object within a specific application context. To fully determine the expected properties of the DT, this article surveys the state-of-the-art starting from the original definition within the manufacturing industry. It takes into account related proposals emerging in other fields, namely augmented and virtual reality (e.g., avatars), multiagent systems, and virtualization. This survey thereby allows for the identification of an extensive set of DT features that point to the “softwarization” of POs. To properly consolidate a shared DT definition, a set of foundational properties is identified and proposed as a common ground outlining the essential characteristics (must-haves) of a DT. Once the DT definition has been consolidated, its technical and business value is discussed in terms of applicability and opportunities. Four application scenarios illustrate how the DT concept can be used and how some industries are applying it. The scenarios also lead to a generic DT architectural model. This analysis is then complemented by the identification of software architecture models and guidelines in order to present a general functional framework for the DT. This article, eventually, analyses a set of possible evolution paths for the DT considering its possible usage as a major enabler for the softwarization process.\n",

      "Offshore wind turbine operations and maintenance: A state-of-the-art review\n",
      "Operations and maintenance of offshore wind turbines (OWTs) play an important role in the development of offshore wind farms. Compared with operations, maintenance is a critical element in the levelized cost of energy, given the practical constraints imposed by offshore operations and the relatively high costs. The effects of maintenance on the life cycle of an offshore wind farm are highly complex and uncertain. The selection of maintenance strategies influences the overall efficiency, profit margin, safety, and sustainability of offshore wind farms. For an offshore wind project, after a maintenance strategy is selected, schedule planning will be considered, which is an optimization problem. Onsite maintenance will involve complex marine operations whose efficiency and safety depend on practical factors. Moreover, negative environmental impacts due to offshore maintenance deserve attention. To address these issues, this paper reviews the state-of-the-art research on OWT maintenance, covering strategy selection, schedule optimization, onsite operations, repair, assessment criteria, recycling, and environmental concerns. Many methods are summarized and compared. Limitations in the research and shortcomings in industrial development of OWT operations and maintenance are described. Finally, promising areas are identified with regard to future studies of maintenance strategies.\n",

      "Digital Twin for the Oil and Gas Industry: Overview, Research Trends, Opportunities, and Challenges\n",
      "With the emergence of industry 4.0, the oil and gas (O&G) industry is now considering a range of digital technologies to enhance productivity, efficiency, and safety of their operations while minimizing capital and operating costs, health and environment risks, and variability in the O&G project life cycles. The deployment of emerging technologies allows O&G companies to construct digital twins (DT) of their assets. Considering DT adoption, the O&G industry is still at an early stage with implementations limited to isolated and selective applications instead of industry-wide implementation, limiting the benefits from DT implementation. To gain the full potential of DT and related technological adoption, a comprehensive understanding of DT technology, the current status of O&G-related DT research activities, and the opportunities and challenges associated with the deployment of DT in the O&G industry are of paramount importance. In order to develop this understanding, this paper presents a literature review of DT within the context of the O&G industry. The paper follows a systematic approach to select articles for the literature review. First, a keywords-based publication search was performed on the scientific databases such as Elsevier, IEEE Xplore, OnePetro, Scopus, and Springer. The filtered articles were then analyzed using online text analytic software (Voyant Tools) followed by a manual review of the abstract, introduction and conclusion sections to select the most relevant articles for our study. These articles and the industrial publications cited by them were thoroughly reviewed to present a comprehensive overview of DT technology and to identify current research status, opportunities and challenges of DT deployment in the O&G industry. From this literature review, it was found that asset integrity monitoring, project planning, and life cycle management are the key application areas of digital twin in the O&G industry while cyber security, lack of standardization, and uncertainty in scope and focus are the key challenges of DT deployment in the O&G industry. When considering the geographical distribution for the DT related research in the O&G industry, the United States (US) is the leading country, followed by Norway, United Kingdom (UK), Canada, China, Italy, Netherland, Brazil, Germany, and Saudi Arabia. The overall publication rate was less than ten articles (approximately) per year until 2017, and a significant increase occurred in 2018 and 2019. The number of journal publications was noticeably lower than the number of conference publications, and the majority of the publications presented theoretical concepts rather than the industrial implementations. Both these observations suggest that the DT implementation in the O&G industry is still at an early stage.\n",

      "A Big Data Analytics Method for the Evaluation of Ship - Ship Collision Risk reflecting Hydrometeorological Conditions\n",
      "This paper presents a big data analytics method for the evaluation of ship-ship collision risk in real operational conditions. The approach makes use of big data from Automatic Identification System (AIS) and nowcast data corresponding to time-dependent traffic situations and hydro-meteorological conditions respectively. An Avoidance Behavior-based Collision Detection Model (ABCD-M) is introduced to identify potential collision scenarios and Collision Risk Indices (CRIs) are quantified when evasive actions are taken for each detected collision scenario in various voyages. The method is applied on Ro-Pax ships operating over 13 months of the ice-free period in the Gulf of Finland. Results indicate that collision risk estimates may be extremely diverse among voyages, and in 97.5% of potential collision scenarios the evasive actions are triggered only when risk is at 45% or more of its maximum value. The overall CRI for ships operating over the given area tends to be lower for adverse hydro-meteorological conditions. It is therefore concluded that the proposed method may assist with the (1) identification of critical scenarios in various voyages not currently accounted for by existing accident databases, (2) definition of commonly agreed risk criteria to set off alarms, (3) the estimation of risk profile over the life cycle of fleet operations.\n",

      "In Earth observation (EO), large-scale land-surface dynamics are traditionally analyzed by investigating aggregated classes. The increase in data with a very high spatial resolution enables investigations on a fine-grained feature level which can help us to better understand the dynamics of land surfaces by taking object dynamics into account. To extract fine-grained features and objects, the most popular deep-learning model for image analysis is commonly used: the convolutional neural network (CNN). In this review, we provide a comprehensive overview of the impact of deep learning on EO applications by reviewing 429 studies on image segmentation and object detection with CNNs. We extensively examine the spatial distribution of study sites, employed sensors, used datasets and CNN architectures, and give a thorough overview of applications in EO which used CNNs. Our main finding is that CNNs are in an advanced transition phase from computer vision to EO. Upon this, we argue that in the near future, investigations which analyze object dynamics with CNNs will have a significant impact on EO research. With a focus on EO applications in this Part II, we complete the methodological review provided in Part I.\n",

      "Global wind energy has developed rapidly in recent years, and the offshore wind turbines (OWTs) have been applied to much more applications. Because the support structure of an OWT is prone to damage, it is crucial to strengthen the structural reliability to prevent unexpected failures and reduce operation costs by performing fault diagnosis, remaining useful life prediction, and condition-based maintenance. Through real-time monitoring on the operating status of the OWT support structures, the operation measurements can be obtained to detect initial structural cracks and predict the crack propagation to assess potential risks and perform just-in-time maintenance; as a result, the turbine downtime and maintenance costs can be significantly reduced and the wind turbine service life can be prolonged. This paper introduces the latest progress on the reliability analysis of the OWT support structures. First of all, the types of the support structures are reviewed; then, the reliability research progress on the support structure is presented and the existing challenges are discussed. In light of the digital twin (DT) technology, a solution to existing challenging issues is proposed by introducing the DT into the OWT support structures. This new DT framework will enable real-time monitoring, fault diagnosis and operation optimization of the OWT support structures, which may provide a useful application prospect in the reliability analysis of the OWT support structures in the future.\n",

      "Digital technologies integrated into port logistics are becoming increasingly decisive among port cities around the world. This growing importance is due to the need for policymakers, urban managers, port authorities, local administrators, shipping companies, couriers, and so on to develop increasingly digitalized and sustainable logistic processes. Therefore, in a global context characterized by intense datafication and globalization of trade, the data-based approach has become a necessary modus operandi to promote smart and sustainable logistics development. This forward-looking model of port logistics uses technologies such as IoT, sensors, cloud computing platforms, Big Data analytics, Artificial Intelligence (AI), GPS tracking systems, radars, drones, real-time monitoring stations, smart grids, and so on in order to collect, process, monitor and analyse data and information concerning the economic, environmental, social and technological sphere of port cities. In this sense, mobile and fixed platforms help logistics operators to optimize the management of flows (e.g., water, waste, emissions, raw materials, people, monetary investments, etc.) in an efficient and digitized manner. The study proposes a systematic literature review of the most recurring themes concerning smart and sustainable logistics initiatives within port cities in order to develop a multidimensional framework capable of holistically integrating the prevailing enabling factors (Ecosystem, Internal Organization, Data and Security, Policy and Regulation, Finance and Funding, and Digital and Technology), domains (Mobility, Environment, Economy, Telecommunications, Safety and Security, Government, and Community) and goals (Sustainable Development and Digitalization) that characterize smart and sustainable logistical development. To this end, the best practices of several pioneering port cities such as Rotterdam, Hamburg, Singapore, Los Angeles, Amsterdam, etc. implemented in partnerships with technology companies such as Cisco, IBM, Huawei and SAP were also analysed. Therefore, the results of this research show that smart and sustainable logistics initiatives in port cities: (a) have the potential to enhance the efficiency of the economic, environmental, social and technological flows; (b) increase the involvement and awareness of stakeholders such as couriers, shippers, shipping companies, citizens, port authorities, municipalities, security officers, gate and terminal personnel, and so on; and (c) provide a detailed overview of the enabling factors, domains and goals that must be activated by port cities to foster a smart and sustainable logistic transition.\n",

For this, a new dynamic modeling method for investigating a multi-body dynamics system of this coupling system is employed. Firstly, the structure and hardware composition of the proposed system are presented. The USV and UUV are modeled as rigid-body vehicles, and the flexible UC is discretized using the catenary equation. In order to solve the nonlinear coupled dynamics of the vehicles and flexible UC, the fourth-order Runge–Kutta numerical method is implemented. In modeling the flexible UC dynamics, the shooting method is applied to solve a two-point boundary value problem of the catenary equation. The interaction between the UC and the USV–UUV system is investigated through numerical simulations in the time domain. Through the computer simulation, the behavior of the coupled USV–UC–UUV system is analyzed for three situations which can occur. In particular, variation of the UC forces and moments at the tow points and the configuration of the UC in the water are investigated.\n",

      "To counteract a potential reduction in grid stability caused by a rapidly growing share of intermittent renewable energy sources within our electrical grids, large scale deployment of energy storage will become indispensable. Pumped hydro storage is widely regarded as the most cost-effective option for this. However, its application is traditionally limited to certain topographic features. Expanding its operating range to low-head scenarios could unlock the potential of widespread deployment in regions where so far it has not yet been feasible. This review aims at giving a multi-disciplinary insight on technologies that are applicable for low-head (2-30 m) pumped hydro storage, in terms of design, grid integration, control, and modelling. A general overview and the historical development of pumped hydro storage are presented and trends for further innovation and a shift towards application in low-head scenarios are identified. Key drivers for future deployment and the technological and economic challenges to do so are discussed. Based on these challenges, technologies in the field of pumped hydro storage are reviewed and specifically analysed regarding their fitness for low-head application. This is done for pump and turbine design and configuration, electric machines and control, as well as modelling. Further aspects regarding grid integration are discussed. Among conventional machines, it is found that, for high-flow low-head application, axial flow pump-turbines with variable speed drives are the most suitable. Machines such as Archimedes screws, counter-rotating and rotary positive displacement reversible pump-turbines have potential to emerge as innovative solutions. Coupled axial flux permanent magnet synchronous motor-generators are the most promising electric machines. To ensure grid stability, grid-forming control alongside bulk energy storage with capabilities of providing synthetic inertia next to other ancillary services are required.\n",

The results of the study also show that cases on blockchain application in other fields increase the industry willingness to its application on the maritime industry. While having blockchain implementation specialized third parties would increase the implementation possibility and the industry willingness due to reduced costs and friction. The study will be interesting for scholars, policy-makers and practitioners from the maritime industry.\n",

      "Data-driven modelling of ship propulsion and the effect of data pre-processing on the prediction of ship fuel consumption and speed loss\n",
      "Data-driven models for ship propulsion are presented while the effect of data pre-processing techniques is extensively examined. In this study, a large, automatically collected with high sampling frequency data set is exploited for training models that estimate the required shaft power or main engine fuel consumption of a container ship sailing under arbitrary conditions. Emphasis is given to the statistical evaluation and pre-processing of the data and two algorithms are presented for this scope. Additionally, state-of-the-art techniques for training and optimizing Feed-Forward Neural Networks (FNNs) are applied. The results indicate that with a delicate filtering and preparation stage it is possible to significantly increase the model's accuracy. Therefore, increase the prediction ability and awareness regarding the ship's hull and propeller actual condition. Furthermore, such models could be employed in studies targeting at the improvement of ship's operational energy efficiency.\n",

      "Due to the rapid development of the fifth-generation (5G) applications, and increased demand for even faster communication networks, we expected to witness the birth of a new 6G technology within the next ten years. Many references suggested that the 6G wireless network standard may arrive around 2030. Therefore, this paper presents a critical analysis of 5G wireless networks’, significant technological limitations and reviews the anticipated challenges of the 6G communication networks. In this work, we have considered the applications of three of the highly demanding domains, namely: energy, Internet-of-Things (IoT) and machine learning. To this end, we present our vision on how the 6G communication networks should look like to support the applications of these domains. This work presents a thorough review of 370 papers on the application of energy, IoT and machine learning in 5G and 6G from three major libraries: Web of Science, ACM Digital Library, and IEEE Explore.

      "Cyber situational awareness has been proven to be of value in forming a comprehensive understanding of threats and vulnerabilities within organisations, as the degree of exposure is governed by the prevailing levels of cyber-hygiene and established processes. A more accurate assessment of the security provision informs on the most vulnerable environments that necessitate more diligent management. The rapid proliferation in the automation of cyber-attacks is reducing the gap between information and operational technologies and the need to review the current levels of robustness against new sophisticated cyber-attacks, trends, technologies and mitigation countermeasures has become pressing. A deeper characterisation is also the basis with which to predict future vulnerabilities in turn guiding the most appropriate deployment technologies. Thus, refreshing established practices and the scope of the training to support the decision making of users and operators. The foundation of the training provision is the use of Cyber-Ranges (CRs) and Test-Beds (TBs), platforms/tools that help inculcate a deeper understanding of the evolution of an attack and the methodology to deploy the most impactful countermeasures to arrest breaches. In this paper, an evaluation of documented CRs and TBs platforms is evaluated. CRs and TBs are segmented by type, technology, threat scenarios, applications and the scope of attainable training. To enrich the analysis of documented CRs and TBs research and cap the study, a taxonomy is developed to provide a broader comprehension of the future of CRs and TBs. The taxonomy elaborates on the CRs/TBs dimensions, as well as, highlighting a diminishing differentiation between application areas.\n",

      "In Operational Research conventional simulation practices typically focus on the conceptualization, development and use of a single model simulated on a single computer by a single analyst. Since the late 1970s the field of Distributed Simulation has led research into how to speed up simulation and how to compose large-scale simulations consisting of many reusable models running using distributed computers. There have been significant advances in the theories and technologies underpinning Distributed Simulation and there have been major successes in defence, computer systems design and smart urban environments. However, from an Operational Research perspective, Distributed Simulation has had little impact on mainstream research and practice. To argue the potential benefits of Distributed Simulation for Operational Research, this article gives an overview of Distributed Simulation approaches and technologies as well as discussing the state-of-the-art of Distributed Simulation applications. It will investigate the potential advantages of Distributed Simulation for Operational Research and present a possible sustainable future, based on experiences from e-Science, that will help Operational Research meet future challenges such as those emerging from Big Data Analytics, Cyber-physical systems, Industry 4.0, Digital Twins and Smart environments.\n",

      "The global trend toward customization in the automotive sector has led to significant increase in the variability of components available to the assembly process. The increase in product variability directly impacts the complexity of the manufacturing process and consequently increases the possibility for human-generated error. Several solutions have been offered to reduce the potential risk of error in complex assembly processes which can be generalized as cognitive-based or physical-based assistive methods. Creating a digital twin of the process, both the human and machine elements, is a preliminary requirement before deploying such solutions in a real-world manufacturing environment. The digital twin simulation provides a platform for testing a variety of solutions and what-if scenarios to improve planning and decision making. While there exist commercially available products of human digital twin modeling, these do not provide a proper platform for human – machine interaction modeling. In the context of this work, machine is defined as an industrial robot with an objective of investigating the feasibility of deploying a smart collaborative robotic solution to provide physical assistance to the human worker in a cumbersome manufacturing process. To do so, an overhead assembly operation from a real-world vehicle assembly plant is identified, and a digital twin of human model is created in Siemens Tecnomatix suite. The study starts with the simulation of various human anthropomorphic models to discover the limitations in performing the assembly tasks based on gender, weight and height. Furthermore, a digital twin of a mobile robot designed to provide physical assistance to the human to perform the assembly operation is introduced. The results are evaluated in terms of process time, joint ergonomic impact and reveal some current limitations of combined digital twin modeling of humans and robots collaborating.\n",

This paper presents DT information visualizations & outcome loop of global smart ports’ management, and core technique towards smart ports’ processes based on DT-driven management. A systematic framework of DT-based model for smart port’s management is presented, which can be categorized into physical layer, data layer, model layer, service layer and application layer.

Meanwhile, this paper proposes concerned challenges of DT-driven management integrated with optimized cross-platform in smart ports’ processes, to indicate there are barriers ahead to get to an ideal visual-based management system. Current challenges help decision-makers to determine where to find a proper strategy to win, in the future, DT visual applications can be extended in several directions of global port industry.

      "Battery systems are becoming an increasingly attractive alternative for powering ocean going ships, and the number of fully electric or hybrid ships relying on battery power for propulsion and manoeuvring is growing. In order to ensure the safety of such electric ships, it is of paramount importance to monitor the available energy that can be stored in the batteries, and classification societies typically require that the state of health of the batteries can be verified by independent tests — annual capacity tests. However, this paper discusses data-driven state of health modelling for maritime battery systems based on operational sensor data collected from the batteries as an alternative approach. Thus, this paper presents a comprehensive review of different data-driven approaches to state of health modelling, and aims at giving an overview of current state of the art. More than 300 papers have been reviewed, most of which are referred to in this paper. Moreover, some reflections and discussions on what types of approaches can be suitable for modelling and independent verification of state of health for maritime battery systems are presented.\n",

      "3D printing conquers new branches of production due to becoming a more reliable and professional method of manufacturing. The benefits of additive manufacturing such as part optimization, weight reduction, and ease of prototyping were factors accelerating the popularity of 3D printing. Additive manufacturing has found its niches, inter alia, in automotive, aerospace and dentistry. Although further research in those branches is still required, in some specific applications, additive manufacturing (AM) can be beneficial. It has been proven that additively manufactured parts have the potential to out perform the conventionally manufactured parts due to their mechanical properties; however, they must be designed for specific 3D printing technology, taking into account its limitations. The maritime industry has a long-standing tradition and is based on old, reliable techniques; therefore it implements new solutions very carefully. Besides, shipbuilding has to face very high classification requirements that force the use of technologies that guarantee repeatability and high quality. This paper provides information about current R&D works in the field of implementing AM in shipbuilding, possible benefits, opportunities and threats of implementation.\n",

      "Today, modelling and simulation technologies are extensively used in the maritime industry. As a reaction to changing market demands and environmental challenges, maritime systems are becoming more complex and coupled. Digital approaches such as digital twins and co-simulation are coping these challenges and offer new opportunities throughout the lifecycle of a vessel. In this work, we present the digital twin modelling and the co-simulation of a typical AC ship power and propulsion system including the power stage, relevant local controllers and a high-level controller. The power and control components are modelled individually and exported as Functional Mock-up Units (FMUs). To perform a co-simulation of the ship electric power system, the Open Simulation Platform (OSP) is utilized. This co-simulation environment connects the individual FMUs and routes the data between the sub-simulators of the digital twin. A typical test scenario is carried out to demonstrate the correct functioning of the ship power and propulsion system as well as the OSP environment.\n",

      "As the fifth-generation (5G) wireless communication networks are at the stage of commercial deployment, beyond 5G (B5G)/sixth-generation (6G) wireless communication networks have also been under extensive research. In the B5G/6G era, the vision of the wireless communication network is the so-termed space-air-ground-sea integrated network (SAGSIN), which will focus on more various and dynamic communication scenarios, including vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V), high-speed train (HST), unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), satellite, and maritime communications. Meanwhile, B5G/6G communication systems will also employ two potential technologies, i.e., millimeter wave (mmWave)-terahertz (THz) and ultra-massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO), and have a new development trend, i.e., integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) systems. For the successful design of B5G/6G communication systems, accurate and easy-to-use channel models, which can fully mimic the underlying characteristics and features of B5G/6G channels, are indispensable. However, more diverse communication scenarios, higher frequency band, larger-scale antenna array, and the emergence of ISAC systems in B5G/6G will bring two significant points of concern for wireless channels, i.e., channel non-stationarity and channel consistency. Channel non-stationarity is a typical channel characteristic, whereas channel consistency is an inherent channel physical feature. To capture those, extensive works have been carried out, but have not yet been adequately summarized, compared, and analyzed. This paper first provides the definitions of channel non-stationarity and channel consistency from mathematical and physical perspectives, and then discusses the necessity of capturing them for various wireless applications. Recent advances in the topic of capturing channel non-stationarity and channel consistency are further elaborated and investigated. Additionally, simulation results concerning them are provided and analyzed. Finally, promising and meaningful future research directions for this topic are outlined.\n",

We then develop a future research agenda on industrial digitalization at both a conceptual and an empirical level, encompassing the following themes: (i) the need for a more nuanced conceptualization; (ii) the potential evolution of one or more digital technologies toward the category of “general-purpose technology”; (iii) the search for new contingency approaches; (iv) the development of accurate models of inter-firm collaboration among digital manufacturers; and (v) the elaboration of suitable solutions able to guarantee the compatibility of industrial digitalization with ethical and sustainability principles.\n",

      "Sustainable use of the ocean for food and energy production is an emerging area of research in different countries around the world. This goal is pursued by the Australian aquaculture, offshore engineering and renewable energy industries, research organisations and the government through the “Blue Economy Cooperative Research Centre”. To address the challenges of offshore food and energy production, leveraging the benefits of co-location, vertical integration, infrastructure and shared services, will be enabled through the development of novel Multi-Purpose Offshore-Platforms (MPOP). The structural integrity of the designed systems when being deployed in the harsh offshore environment is one of the main challenges in developing the MPOPs. Employing structural reliability analysis methods for assessing the structural safety of the novel aquaculture-MPOPs comes with different limitations. This review aims at shedding light on these limitations and discusses the current status and future directions for structural reliability analysis of a novel aquaculture-MPOP considering Australia’s unique environment. To achieve this aim, challenges which exist at different stages of reliability assessment, from data collection and uncertainty quantification to load and structural modelling and reliability analysis implementation, are discussed. Furthermore, several solutions to these challenges are proposed based on the existing knowledge in other sectors, and particularly from the offshore oil and gas industry. Based on the identified gaps in the review process, potential areas for future research are introduced to enable a safer and more reliable operation of the MPOPs.\n",

      "A comparative investigation of data-driven approaches based on one-class classifiers for condition monitoring of marine machinery system\n",
      "The safety and reliability of ship navigation depend heavily on the performance of the marine machinery system, which can be maintained at a high level by condition based maintenance. Intelligent condition monitoring is the key to achieve condition based maintenance. However, it is not easy to realize intelligent condition monitoring in a real ship, because there are not enough labeled fault samples to train an accurate detection model. In fact, the potential value of a large number of normal samples collected by the shipboard monitoring system has not been mined out. Since one-class classifiers only need one-class samples to train the detection models, they are very suitable for such occasions. In this paper, we investigate the performance of several representative one-class classifiers, such as OCSVM (One class support vector machine), SVDD (Support vector data description), GKNN (Global k-nearest neighbors), LOF (Local outlier factor), IForest (Isolation forest) and ABOD (Angle-based outlier detection), in condition monitoring of the marine machinery system. The dataset of a marine gas turbine propulsion system is used for a case study, which is a simulation dataset verified by the real ship data. Compared with previous literatures, our new work is to investigate the performance of a variety of key one-class classifiers, not only considering the common evaluation indexes for machine learning, but also considering the sample combinations of the training dataset, distribution of misclassified samples, and the tolerance to contaminated data. The experimental results show that these algorithms have good performance in the dataset in some common evaluation indexes. However, they show some obvious performance differences in some novel evaluation indexes we proposed. This can provide decision support for the application of one-class classifiers in the condition monitoring of many other marine machinery systems.\n",

      "Currently, it is highly desirable to develop a stable and effective antifouling coating in maritime industries. In this work, a novel surface-active copolymer basing on hydrophilic polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) and hydrophobic poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS) was designed and incorporated into a crosslinked PDMS matrix to form a surface-renewable antifouling coating. In the copolymer, PVP segments possessed a chemical stability and could prevent the settlement of fouling organisms attributable to its strong hydrophilicity; PDMS endowed the copolymer with compatibility to PDMS matrix and could efficiently reduce the fouling adhesion strength attributable to the low surface energy. Based on the surface-active copolymer, the coating could be reconstructed underwater in response to the environment forming a renewable surface to promote the fouling-release property. In addition, a set of controllable composition coatings were prepared to investigate the effects of surface chemistry on antifouling and fouling-release performance. Laboratory bioassays against marine unicellular diatom adhesion (∼99 % reduction) and mimetic barnacle attachment (∼81 % reduction) demonstrated an outstanding antifouling and fouling-release property of the copolymer-based coating compared to pristine PDMS, and the coating with a higher PVP content exhibited a better performance. Moreover, a long-term antifouling capability in marine field test (∼4 months) was also demonstrated. This work may offer a promising solution to the problems induced by marine biofouling.\n",

      "Effect analysis on energy efficiency enhancement of controlled cylinder liner temperatures in marine diesel engines with model based approach\n",
      "In recent years, growing interest in engine efficiency, because of international regulations in the maritime sector, necessitates studies about new operational techniques. Ships have been operating at reduced speeds in recent years and, the liner temperatures of marine diesel engines vary significantly at reduced loads, which increase the heat loss from main engine. The research focuses on revealing the energy efficiency enhancement potential by decreasing heat loss through jacket water during reduced loads without any permanent modification. The heat loss reduction is achieved by means of higher coolant (glycol–water mixture) temperatures, to keep the liner temperatures at their maximum permissible temperatures. The methodology is calculating the energy balance and efficiency increment at reduced loads of main engine by modelling. The model have been validated with the digital twin of a two-stroke Sulzer-12RTA84C marine diesel engine. The simulated results comprise in-cylinder pressures, exhaust gas temperature and pressure, scavenge pressure, engine speed, turbo-charger, indicated power and heat transfer rate. Liner temperatures, affecting the heat transfer rate, are investigated in variable operating loads of the main engine. The study shows that keeping the liner temperature of the engine at the maximum continuous rating’s temperature, has respectable efficiency advantages under different operating loads. 0.5% reduction in fuel consumption could be achieved, coming with 127.8 tons fuel and 398 tons CO2 reduction in a year. Additionally, waste heat recovery system calculations were carried out and additional 48.8 tons of fuel could be saved in the generation of electricity. In total 176.6 tons of fuel and 550 tons of CO2 emission reduction could be achieved. As a result, the controlled cylinder wall temperatures can be considered as one of the methods to solve the efficiency and emission problems in ships in the near future.\n",

      "Development of a diesel engine's digital twin for predicting propulsion system dynamics\n",
      "A digital twin is the essential part of a recent and unavoidable trend in ship operation digitalisation. The digital twin is a virtual replica of real ship or a particular system that coexists with its physical counterpart and maps the dynamic behaviour in real-time. Thus, the digital twin combines physical space real-time data with a set of dynamic models representing the physical counterpart in the cyberspace. The problem of digital twin development is a trade-off between insight into the dynamic process and real-time execution constraint. This paper describes a modelling approach that combines continuous time-domain cycle-mean value engine model with the crank-angle resolved phenomenological combustion model, satisfying the real-time execution constraint. The set of conservation laws, notably energy and mass, supplemented with the phenomenological Wiebe combustion model, is treated in the integral form allowing transformation into a set of nonlinear algebraic equations. The solution of the resulting system exhibits fast speed and accuracy as compared with the traditional approach combining differential equations and Runge-Kutta solver.\n",

      "As one of the key technologies for realizing a fully digitalized world, the Internet of Things (IoT) requires ubiquitous connections across both land and sea. However, due to lack of infrastructure such as optical fibers and base stations, maritime communications inevitably face a highly complex and heterogeneous environment, which greatly challenges the connection reliability and traffic steering efficiency for future service-oriented maritime IoT. With the recent burgeoning application of artificial intelligence (AI) in many fields, an AI-empowered autonomous network for maritime IoT is envisioned as a promising solution. However, AI typically involves training/learning processes, which require realistic data/environment in order to obtain valuable outcomes. To this end, this article proposes the parallel network, which can be regarded as the \"digital twin\" of the real network and is responsible for realizing four key functionalities: self-learning and optimizing, state inference and network cognition, event prediction and anomaly detection, and knowledge database and snapshots. We then explain how various AI methods can facilitate the operation of the parallel- network-driven maritime network. A case study is provided to demonstrate the idea. Research directions are also outlined for further studies.\n",

      "Reduced environmental impact of marine transport through speed reduction and wind assisted propulsion\n",
      "To achieve IMO’s goal of a 50% reduction of GHG emission by 2050 (compared to the 2008 levels), shipping must not only work towards an optimization of each ship and its components but aim for an optimization of the complete marine transport system, including fleet planning, harbour logistics, route planning, speed profiles, weather routing and ship design. ShipCLEAN, a newly developed model, introduces a coupling of a marine transport economics model to a sophisticated ship energy systems model – it provides a leap towards a holistic optimization of marine transport systems. This paper presents how the model is applied to propose a reduction in fuel consumption and environmental impact by speed reduction of a container ship on a Pacific Ocean trade and the implementation of wind assisted propulsion on a MR Tanker on a North Atlantic trade. The main conclusions show that an increase of the fuel price, for example by applying a bunker levy, will lead to considerable, economically motivated speed reductions in liner traffic. The case study sowed possible yearly fuel savings of almost 21 300 t if the fuel price would be increased from 300 to 1000 USD/t. Accordingly, higher fuel prices can motivate the installation of wind assisted propulsion, which potentially saves up to 500 t of fuel per year for the investigated MR Tanker on a transatlantic route.\n",

      "Fault diagnosis of marine machinery is of utmost importance in modern ships. The widely used machine learning techniques have made it possible to realize intelligent diagnosis by using large amounts of sensory data. However, the detection of simultaneous faults is still a challenge in the absence of simultaneous fault data. Multi-label classification has recently gained popularity in simultaneous fault diagnosis with promising results. The contribution of this work is to carry out a comparative study of several state-of-the-art multi-label classification algorithms for simultaneous fault diagnosis of marine machinery based on single fault data. The proposed method is experimentally validated with a dataset generated from a real data validated simulator of a Frigate. The experimental results show the effectiveness of the proposed method, which can provide decision support for the application of multi-label classification in the simultaneous fault diagnosis of similar marine systems.\n",

To sufficiently represent the combustion process, a multi-Wiebe function approach was employed, whereas a database for storing the combustion model parameters was developed. The developed model was employed for the systematic investigation of a marine four-stroke dual fuel engine response during demanding transient operation with mode switching and load changes. The derived results were analysed to identify the critical engine components and their effect on the engine operational limitations. The results demonstrate that the developed model can sufficiently represent the engine and its subsystems/components behaviour and effectively capture the engine control system’s functionality. The appropriate turbocharger matching along with the sufficient design of the exhaust gas waste gate valve and fuel control systems are crucial for ensuring the smooth engine operation of dual fuel engines.\n",

      "Today, the built environment is designed, built, and managed using digital technology, making it increasingly exposed to cyber security risks. Cybersecurity is a general topic, and the construction sector has been borrowing general solutions and frameworks. However, the construction industry is specific and needs a specialized framework that would assist in understanding and managing cybersecurity. We have studied general cybersecurity frameworks, cybersecurity standards, research literature, and first principles of systems theory and process engineering. Drawing from that, we developed an original framework that identifies three kinds of wrongful activities: stealing, lying, and harming. It identifies four elements that can be affected by wrongful activities: information asset, material asset, person, and system. It defines cybersecurity as the absence of the three wrongs across the four kinds of elements. The framework is construction-specific, and as such, a useful tool for senior management to understand security problems and organize security processes. It can lead to better standardization and also helps the researchers to structure future work on the topic. The latter should be concentrated in areas where construction was found to be different: the dynamic and overlapping process and organizational boundaries in the design stage, the exposed shared design information, and the vulnerability of control information of the built environment, particularly in critical infrastructures.\n",

      "Tuning of transfer functions for analysis of wave–ship interactions\n",
      "Transfer functions are often used together with a wave spectrum for analysis of wave–ship interactions, where one application addresses the prediction of wave-induced motions or other types of global responses. This paper presents a simple and practical method which can be used to tune the transfer function of such responses to facilitate improved prediction capability. The input to the method consists of a measured response, i.e. time series sequences from a given sensor, the 2D wave spectrum characterising the seaway in which the measurements are taken, and an initial estimate of the transfer function for the response in study. The paper presents results obtained using data from an in-service container ship. The 2D wave spectra are taken from the ERA5 database, while the transfer function is computed by a simple closed-form expression. The paper shows that the application of the tuned transfer function leads to predictions which are significantly improved compared to using the transfer function without tuning.\n",

      "As climate change is exacerbated and existing resources are depleted, the need for sustainable industries becomes ever so important. Aviation is not an exception. Despite the overall carbon dioxide emissions related to the aviation sector accounts for 2%–4% currently, forecasts for air travel indicate an annual growth of 3%–5% and other industries present more potential to reduce carbon emissions once they recur to an increasing use of renewable energies. This option is more difficult in aeronautics since an efficient and lighter energy storage system is required and the current state of the art in battery technology is far from the specific energy densities of fossil fuels and its production is not friendly to the environment. Thus, a herculean effort to integrate several promising mitigation strategies in an efficient way is required. In this paper, a review of the most upfront solutions towards greener aviation is presented and categorized as follows: concepts of operations, energy storage, propulsion systems, aerodynamics, structures, materials, and manufacturing processes. In the end, potential synergies between the different technologies to achieve green aviation are proposed.\n",

      "BIM has been playing a pivotal role during the last decade in bringing in revolutionary and systematic changes, especially for the design and construction stages in bridge engineering; while the emerging Digital Twin (DT) technology, mainly applied in the operation and maintenance phases, has great potential to shape a DT-enhanced BIM framework to fully enable whole life cycle digital construction. However, the current adoption of DT in bridge engineering causes conceptual and technical confusion, which hinders the technology fusion to achieve its full potential. This paper aims at filling the gap by conceptualizing a DT-enhanced BIM framework from the perspective of bridge engineering. In total, 116 documents on BIM and DT were reviewed, compared, and analyzed; a crucial metrics based performance hierarchy for bridge digital twin was concluded and a DT-enhanced BIM framework was proposed to promote full lifecycle digital bridge engineering implementation. Furthermore, the analysis and conceptual development align well with the existing mature BIM framework and are expected to contribute actively to the future development of BIM and DT and their integrated advanced technologies.\n",

The major enabler for this exciting ecosystem is the provision of broadband, low-delay, and reliable wireless coverage to the ever-increasing number of vessels, buoys, platforms, sensors, and actuators. Towards this end, the integration of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in maritime communications introduces an aerial dimension to wireless connectivity going above and beyond current deployments, which are mainly relying on shore-based base stations with limited coverage and satellite links with high latency. Considering the potential of UAV-aided wireless communications, this survey presents the state-of-the-art in UAV-aided maritime communications, which, in general, are based on both conventional optimization and machine-learning-aided approaches. More specifically, relevant UAV-based network architectures are discussed together with the role of their building blocks. Then, physical-layer, resource management, and cloud/edge computing and caching UAV-aided solutions in maritime environments are discussed and grouped based on their performance targets. Moreover, as UAVs are characterized by flexible deployment with high re-positioning capabilities, studies on UAV trajectory optimization for maritime applications are thoroughly discussed. In addition, aiming at shedding light on the current status of real-world deployments, experimental studies on UAV-aided maritime communications are presented and implementation details are given. Finally, several important open issues in the area of UAV-aided maritime communications are given, related to the integration of sixth generation (6G) advancements. These future challenges include physical-layer aspects, non-orthogonal multiple access schemes, radical learning paradigms for swarms of UAVs and unmanned surface and underwater vehicles, as well as UAV-aided edge computing and caching.\n",

      "The so-called “Fourth Industrial revolution”, also termed as “Industry 4.0” in the wider literature, is associated with several cutting-edge technologies. Indicative examples in this category are advanced applications like Artificial Intelligence (AI), Big Data Analytics (BDA), Cloud Computing and Internet of Things (IoT), which are already influencing the maritime industry. It is indicative of the fact that there are several construction projects of autonomous ships, such as the Yara Birkeland and the Autonomous Spaceport Drone Ship (ASDS), which are heavily reliant on technologies associated with the Industry 4.0 concept. The maritime transport industry is already transitioning into a new operations paradigm, often termed as “shipping in the era of digitalization”. Shipping companies promote digitalization as the future of the maritime industry and their efforts to set up strategies are already in progress. Examining those visions and strategies in relation to digitalization would be beneficial to better understand the way towards which the maritime industry is heading. This paper is aiming to identify the characteristics of that pool of future plans via a qualitative review and with a particular focus on major maritime commercial actors, based on shipping companies' relevant action plans that were gathered online. A conclusion standing out is that major shipping companies have embraced digitalization to increase cost-efficiency, raise competitiveness and meet the needs of their customers.\n",

      "Vessel hydrodynamic model tuning by Discrete Bayesian updating using simulated onboard sensor data\n",
      "Vessel and wave hydrodynamics are fundamental for vessel motion prediction. Improving hydrodynamic model accuracy without compromising computational efficiency has always been of high interest for safe and cost-effective marine operations. With continuous development of sensor technology and computational capacity, an improved digital twin concept for vessel motion prediction can be realized based on an onboard online adaptive hydrodynamic model. This article proposes and demonstrates a practical approach for tuning of important vessel hydrodynamic model parameters based on simulated onboard sensor data of vessel motion response. The algorithm relies fundamentally on spectral analysis, probabilistic modelling and the discrete Bayesian updating formula. All case studies show promising and reasonable tuning results. Sensitivities of the approach with respect to its key parameters were also studied. Sensor noise has been considered. The algorithm is found to be computationally efficient, robust and stable when tuning the values of hydrodynamic parameters and updating their uncertainties, within reasonable sensor noise levels.\n",

Recognizing the value of data as an asset, marine engineering puts data considerations at the core of system design. Used wisely, data can help the shipping sector to achieve operating cost savings and efficiency increase, higher safety, wellness of crew rates, and enhanced environmental protection and security of assets. The main goal of this study is to develop a methodology able to harmonize data collected from various sensors onboard and to implement a scalable and responsible artificial intelligence framework, to recognize patterns that indicate early signs of defective behavior in the operational state of the vessel. Specifically, the methodology examined in the present study is based on a 1D Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) being fed time series directly from the available dataset. For this endeavor, the dataset undergoes a preprocessing procedure. Aspiring to determine the effect of the parameters composing the networks and the values that ensure the best performance, a parametric inquiry is presented, determining the impact of the input period and the degree of degradation that our models identify adequately. The results provide an insightful picture of the applicability of 1D-CNN models in performing condition monitoring in ships, which is not thoroughly examined in the maritime sector for condition monitoring.

      "Wing-diesel engine-powered hybrid ships can effectively reduce fuel consumption and CO2 emissions by using wind energy as the auxiliary driving power. The energy optimization management of the hybrid system can further improve the ship's energy efficiency. To achieve this purpose, it is significant to establish an effective energy consumption model for the energy optimization management of the hybrid system. Therefore, an energy consumption model is established based on the energy conversion analysis of the hybrid power system in this paper. This model can effectively describe the energy consumption of the hybrid ship under different navigational environmental conditions. Then, a joint optimization method of the wing attack angle and of the sailing speed for the hybrid ship is proposed by adopting a swarm intelligence optimization algorithm, in order to reduce energy consumption and CO2 emissions of the hybrid ship under different navigational environmental conditions. Finally, the energy consumption optimization potentials by adopting the hybrid power system and the proposed joint optimization method are analyzed. The results show that the energy consumption and CO2 emissions along a typical route can be reduced by about 4.5%. This study provides an important basis for future practical operations of wing-diesel engine-powered hybrid ships.\n",

      "High-fidelity models capable of accurately predicting ship motion are critical for promoting innovation and efficiency in the maritime industry. However, creating an advanced model that comprehensively represents the system and its interaction with dynamic environments has always been challenging. Many models provide partial knowledge about a system. To handle the deficiency and improve model fidelity, in this artile, we propose a hybrid modeling methodology, in which prior knowledge describing the ship dynamic effects is incorporated into a data-driven calibrator, yielding a representative model with high predictive capability. Enabled by the integration of model estimated ship states into the calibrator, the informative information could be interpreted and carried forward. Simulation and full-scale experiments are conducted on the research vessel Gunnerus to exemplify the concept. A best available numerical model and a neural network are prepared to be the foundation and calibrator, respectively. Experiment results show that the cooperative model greatly improves the predictive capability of the research vessel. From the ship modeling perspective, this study provides new insights by bridging the gap between two separate domains: 1) model-based and 2) data-driven.\n",

It may be seen as a manifestation of technological progression which has been traditionally given a strong emphasis in theories of economic growth. The roots of digitalization are thus old, but the terminology has experienced rapid growth during the last decades. This paper focuses on the future prospects of digitalization in Finnish ports operating international trade and transports. In the case of transport, logistics, and ports the public sector has, mainly through ministries and offices focusing on economic development and employment, initiated numerous development programs with foresight ambitions. Commonly, these programs have a mid-range target setting referring to a 5–10-years time span into the future. The primary data is collected from two workshops (group interviews). As a result, the research identifies the main drivers and technologies that are significant for port digitalization. These are discussed in the context of three alternative scenarios: Digital supremacy; business as usual; and digital failure. These three scenarios are classified with SWOT (Strengths; Weaknesses; Opportunities; Threats) and PESTEL (Political; Economic; Social; Technological; Environmental; Legal) frameworks. It is assumed that the actualized future development will follow the mid-sections of the scenarios depending on global trends in politics and trade that impact the supply and demand that underlie the need for transport.\n",

In this framework, the digital twin port crane is used as the core, and the multi-sensor data acquisition method, OPC UA information model, and plug-in programming method are combined to realize multi-source heterogeneous virtual and real data fusion. The digital twin crane monitoring system based on this framework can fulfil the following functions: crane historical operation process reproduction, control program simulation testing, synchronous mapping simulation, and remote control. In order to verify the proposed method, a digital twin-based physical platform for monitoring a rail-mounted gantry crane (RMGC) was built, in which a virtual test of anti-swing control and a digital twin monitoring experiment were carried out. The results show that the virtual RMGC can test the control algorithm and map the movement process of the physical RMGC, and the crane operation monitoring system has high real-time performance and good visualization effect.

      "This article brings to attention learning from the failure - blackout, loss of propulsion and near grounding - of Viking Sky cruise ship which occurred in Hustadvika, Norway, in March 2019. Failures and accidents in the cruise ship industry attract the global media and can severely impact reputation and business performance of companies and authorities involved. A system approach investigation and analysis - CAST - was employed with the aim to maximize learning from the Viking Sky’s failure through a systematic approach and to contribute to failure reduction in the cruise ship industry. Three main recommendations emerged from this study: an overview of the accident or failure precursors and resilience indicators; safety recommendations for other cruise ships; lessons and strategies of actions for the increased cruise operations in the Arctic and Antarctic areas. It was found that several accident or failure precursors, for example, a low level of lubricating oil, the failure of a turbocharger, an inoperative large diesel generator, lack of functionality for safety equipment due to bad weather, and others precursors contributed to failure and highly critical situation encountered by Viking Sky in Hustadvika. Resilience indicators such as the master’s immediate decision to launch mayday, the crew preparedness, and the way how the emergency situation was handled were found to have positive impacts on critical situation of Viking Sky. This article highlights also that adaptations and improvement of standards and regulations for harsh environmental conditions can play an important role in prevention of marine accidents. Furthermore, for a better understanding of correlation between environmental loads and their effects on machinery systems, digital solutions such as digital twin for condition monitoring of cruise ships in the Polar areas are seen as possible innovative solutions yet to be fully implemented in the marine industry.\n",

      "The maritime industry expects several improvements to efficiently manage the operation processes by introducing Industry 4.0 enabling technologies. Seaports are the most critical point in the maritime logistics chain because of its multimodal and complex nature. Consequently, coordinated communication among any seaport stakeholders is vital to improving their operations. Currently, Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) and Port Community Systems (PCS), as primary enablers of digital seaports, have demonstrated their limitations to interchange information on time, accurately, efficiently, and securely, causing high operation costs, low resource management, and low performance. For these reasons, this contribution presents the Seaport Data Space (SDS) based on the Industrial Data Space (IDS) reference architecture model to enable a secure data sharing space and promote an intelligent transport multimodal terminal. Each seaport stakeholders implements the IDS connector to take part in the SDS and share their data. On top of SDS, a Big Data architecture is integrated to manage the massive data shared in the SDS and extract useful information to improve the decision-making. The architecture has been evaluated by enabling a port authority and a container terminal to share its data with a shipping company. As a result, several Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) have been developed by using the Big Data architecture functionalities. The KPIs have been shown in a dashboard to allow easy interpretability of results for planning vessel operations. The SDS environment may improve the communication between stakeholders by reducing the transaction costs, enhancing the quality of information, and exhibiting effectiveness.\n",

      "The shipping industry faces a large challenge as it needs to significantly lower the amounts of Green House Gas emissions. Traditionally, reducing the fuel consumption for ships has been achieved during the design stage and, after building a ship, through optimisation of ship operations. In recent years, ship efficiency improvements using Machine Learning (ML) methods are quickly progressing, facilitated by available data from remote sensing, experiments and high-fidelity simulations. The data have been successfully applied to extract intricate empirical rules that can reduce emissions thereby helping achieve green shipping.

Suitable ML approaches are analysed and compared on a scenario basis, with their space for improvements also discussed. Meanwhile, a reminder is given that ML has many inherent uncertainties and hence should be used with caution.\n",

      "Ship performance monitoring using machine-learning\n",
      "The hydrodynamic performance of a sea-going ship varies over its lifespan due to factors like marine fouling and the condition of the anti-fouling paint system. In order to accurately estimate the power demand and fuel consumption for a planned voyage, it is important to assess the hydrodynamic performance of the ship. The current work uses machine-learning (ML) methods to estimate the hydrodynamic performance of a ship using the onboard recorded in-service data. Three ML methods, NL-PCR, NL-PLSR and probabilistic ANN, are calibrated using the data from two sister ships. The calibrated models are used to extract the varying trend in ship’s hydrodynamic performance over time and predict the change in performance through several propeller and hull cleaning events. The predicted change in performance is compared with the corresponding values estimated using the fouling friction coefficient (ΔCF). The ML methods are found to be performing well while modeling the hydrodynamic state of the ships with probabilistic ANN model performing the best, but the results from NL-PCR and NL-PLSR are not far behind, indicating that it may be possible to use simple methods to solve such problems with the help of domain knowledge.\n",

      "Working at an oil and gas facility, such as a drilling rig, production facility, processing facility, or storage facility, involves various challenges, including health and safety risks. It is possible to leverage emerging digital technologies such as smart sensors, wearable or mobile devices, big data analytics, cloud computing, extended reality technologies, robotic systems, and drones to mitigate the challenges faced by oil and gas workers. While these technologies are not new to the oil and gas industry, most of its existing digital transformation initiatives follow business or process-centric approaches, in which the critical driver of the technology adoption is the enhancement of production, efficiency, and revenue. As a result, they may not address the challenges faced by the workers. As oil and gas workers are among the essential assets in the oil and gas industry, it is vital to address the challenges faced by these workers. This paper proposes a human-centric digital transformational framework for the oil and gas industry to deploy existing digital technologies to enhance their workers' health, safety, and working conditions. The paper outlines the critical challenges faced by oilfield workers, introduces a system architecture to implements a human-centric digital transformation, discusses the opportunities of the proposed framework, and summarizes the key impediment for the proposed framework.\n",

      "Digital twin technology is a key technology to realize cyber-physical system. Owing to the problems of low visual monitoring of the blade-rotor test rig and poor equipment monitoring capabilities, this paper proposes a framework based on the digital twin technology. The digital-twin based architecture and major function implementation have been carried out form five dimensions, i.e. Physical layer, Virtual layer, Data layer, Application layer and User layer. Three key technologies utilized to create the system including underlying equipment real-time communication, virtual space building and virtual reality interaction have been demonstrated in this paper. Based on RS-485 and other communication protocols, the data acquisition of the underlying devices have been successfully implemented, and then the real-time data reading has been achieved. Finally, the rationality of the system has been validated by taking the blade-rotor test rig as the application object, which provides a reference for the monitoring and evaluation of equipment involved in manufacturing and experiment.\n",

      "Applications of additively manufactured tools in abrasive machining—A literature review\n",
      "High requirements imposed by the competitive industrial environment determine the development directions of applied manufacturing methods. 3D printing technology, also known as additive manufacturing (AM), currently being one of the most dynamically developing production methods, is increasingly used in many different areas of industry. Nowadays, apart from the possibility of making prototypes of future products, AM is also used to produce fully functional machine parts, which is known as Rapid Manufacturing and also Rapid Tooling. Rapid Manufacturing refers to the ability of the software automation to rapidly accelerate the manufacturing process, while Rapid Tooling means that a tool is involved in order to accelerate the process. Abrasive processes are widely used in many industries, especially for machining hard and brittle materials such as advanced ceramics. This paper presents a review on advances and trends in contemporary abrasive machining related to the application of innovative 3D printed abrasive tools. Examples of abrasive tools made with the use of currently leading AM methods and their impact on the obtained machining results were indicated. The analyzed research works indicate the great potential and usefulness of the new constructions of the abrasive tools made by incremental technologies. Furthermore, the potential and limitations of currently used 3D printed abrasive tools, as well as the directions of their further development are indicated.\n",

      "A new performance adaptation method for aero gas turbine engines based on large amounts of measured data\n",
      "Multiple unexpected uncertainty factors can occur when measuring gas turbine engine data, and the quality of the measured data can directly affect the accuracy of gas turbine engine models during performance adaptation. In the present study, a new performance adaptation method for aero gas turbine engines is proposed to improve prediction accuracy, by effectively processing a large amount of measured data. Adaptation factors were obtained to match the engine model and the measured data of every single operating point. These adaptation factors were then used to adjust the compressor performance, bleed air flow, engine thrust, and exhaust gas temperature. A data clustering technique was employed to exclude physically non-reasonable data points from the time series adaptation factors. The correlations for the adaptation factors were generated by using selected centroids from the clustered data, then the correlations were applied to the engine simulation. As a result, the values in the adapted engine model were in good agreement with transient measurement data. This confirms that the proposed performance adaptation method can be used to generate accurate gas turbine engine models using time series measurement data.\n",

      "The search for sustainability in the Supply Chain (SC) is one of the tasks that most concerns business leaders in all manufacturing sectors because of the importance that the Supply Chain has as a transversal tool and due to the leading role that it has been playing lately. Of all the manufacturing sectors, this study focuses on the aerospace, shipbuilding, and automotive sectors identified as transport. The present study carries out a descriptive review of existing publications in these three sectors in relation to the sustainability of the Supply Chain in its 4.0 adaptation as an update in matters that are in constant evolution. Among the results obtained, Lean practices are common to the three sectors, as well as different technologies focused on sustainability. Furthermore, the results show that the automotive sector is the one that makes the greatest contribution in this sense through collaborative programs that can be very useful to the other two sectors, thus benefiting from the consequent applicable advantages. Meanwhile, the Aerospace and Shipbuilding sectors do not seem to be working on promoting a sustainable culture in the management of the Supply Chain or on including training programs for their personnel in matters related to Industry 4.0.\n",

      "Robust Operation of Shipboard Microgrids with Multiple-Battery Energy Storage System under Navigation Uncertainties\n",
      "Energy storage system (ESS) management benefits the operation of all-electric ships (AESs) since its ability to balance the generation and demand. However, current works rarely consider the influence of navigation uncertainties, i.e., uncertain water waves and winds, and fail to address two characteristics of shipboard ESS, i.e., redundant capacity and distributed locations. In this paper, a two-stage robust optimal shipboard microgrid operation method is proposed to mitigate the pre-voyage and intra-voyage navigation uncertainties. The first stage is to regulate the onboard generation and voyage variables for addressing the worst pre-voyage navigation uncertainties and the second stage is an on-line recourse action which acts on intra-voyage uncertainty realization. To address the characteristics of shipboard ESS, the onboard batteries are separated into two groups and a multi-battery management strategy is proposed for the battery lifetime extension. An AES with 4 DGs and 4 batteries is used in the case studies. The simulation results show that the proposed method can well adapt to the navigation uncertainties and the multi-battery management can extend the battery lifetime by iteratively using different battery groups.\n",

      "Nowadays, we are already involved in the Fourth Industrial Revolution, known as Industry 4.0. Inside this paradigm, IoT is one of fundamental technologies that allows the integration of physical and virtual systems. The important role of the IoT is based on its potential to offer different solutions for the operational of existing industrial system, in order to transform them in digital environments. Following this idea, a proof of concept is presented, applying IIoT (Industrial Internet of Things) in a shipyard. This technology is used as a key enabler to achieved a connected and advanced manufacturing with the aim of improve efficiency in a specific workshop inside the shipyard. This first approach to the transformation of conventional shipyard in a smart factory comprises two parts: the communication between the information systems and the connection with physical devices. The goal is to solve the challenges that arise with the implementation of IIoT and to provide a useful decision tool to operators and managers of the workshop.\n",

      "Virtual hull monitoring of a naval vessel using hindcast data and reconstructed 2-D wave spectra\n",
      "A novel virtual hull monitoring approach is assessed using full-scale measurements from a naval vessel trial to address two questions. First: Can this technique accurately reproduce stress spectra from measured strains? Second: Are responses calculated using reconstructed two-dimensional wave spectra from hindcast data more accurate than those using simpler wave representations? Stresses calculated using wave hindcast data, ship track information, and stress transfer functions compare favorably to those derived from strain gauge measurements at five structural locations. Wave conditions are represented using a spectrum model along with bulk spectral parameters (significant wave height, peak period, and primary direction) from hindcast datasets and by reconstructing two-dimensional spectra from hindcast partition data. Both approaches give good agreement with strain measurements but using the more-detailed reconstructed two-dimensional wave spectra yields better results. Results suggest that wave hindcast data are sufficient for accurate structural calculations, encouraging further study of virtual hull monitoring using wave hindcast data.\n",

      "The sustainable development of port operation management is strongly related to the energy consumption of production at automated container terminals (ACTs). This paper focuses on the production activities at a container yard, which is the primary facility of ACTs. A digital twin-based approach is proposed to optimize the operation of an automatic stacking crane (ASC) handling containers in terms of energy consumption. A virtual container yard that syncs with a physical container yard in the ACT digital twin system for observation and validation is developed. A mathematical model is established to minimize the total energy consumption of completing all tasks. Then, the Q-learning algorithm is adapted to optimize a solution based on the operating data from the ACT digital twin system. Numerical experiments are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach by comparing it with two other solution algorithms, viz., genetic algorithm (GA) and particle swarm optimization (PSO). The total energy consumption of two operation strategies (i.e., centralized and decentralized) are also compared using the proposed digital twin-based approach. With digital twin, the operational environment and energy consumption are visualized to support optimization and management of ASCs. Managers and operators can choose an appropriate strategy according to the designated sustainable goal.\n",

However, the existing insights are scattered over different literature sources and there is a lack of a structured and unbiased review methodology to systematise DS &BDA application areas in the SC &L comprehensively covering efficiency, resilience and sustainability paradigms. In this study, we first propose an unique systematic review methodology for the field of DS &BDA in SC &L. Second, we use the methodology proposed for a systematic literature review on DS &BDA techniques in the SC &L fields aiming at classifying the existing DS &BDA models/techniques employed, structuring their practical application areas, identifying the research gaps and potential future research directions. We analyse 364 publications which use a variety of DS &BDA-driven modelling methods for SC &L processes across different decision-making levels. Our analysis is triangulated across efficiency, resilience, and sustainability perspectives. The developed review methodology and proposed novel classifications and categorisations can be used by researchers and practitioners alike for a structured analysis and applications of DS &BDA in SC &L.\n",

      "Oceans cover more than 70% of the Earth’s surface. For various reasons, almost 95% of these areas remain unexplored. Underwater wireless communication (UWC) has widespread applications, including real-time aquatic data collection, naval surveillance, natural disaster prevention, archaeological expeditions, oil and gas exploration, shipwreck exploration, maritime security, and the monitoring of aquatic species and water contamination. The promising concept of the Internet of Underwater Things (IoUT) is having a great influence in several areas, for example, in small research facilities and average-sized harbors, as well as in huge unexplored areas of ocean. The IoUT has emerged as an innovative technology with the potential to develop a smart ocean. The IoUT framework integrates different underwater communication techniques such as optical, magnetic induction, and acoustic signals. It is capable of revolutionizing industrial projects, scientific research, and business. The key enabler technology for the IoUT is the underwater wireless sensor network (UWSN); however, at present, this is characterized by limitations in reliability, long propagation delays, high energy consumption, a dynamic topology, and limited bandwidth. This study examines the literature to identify potential challenges and risks, as well as mitigating solutions, associated with the IoUT. Our findings reveal that the key contributing elements to the challenges facing the IoUT are underwater communications, energy storage, latency, mobility, a lack of standardization, transmission media, transmission range, and energy constraints. Furthermore, we discuss several IoUT applications while highlighting potential future research directions.\n",

      "The role of seaports has evolved from being simple sea/land interfaces to becoming increasingly value-adding entities in global supply chains. A port that is today at the forefront of this trend is characterized as a fifth generation (5G) port, a “smart port” or, more recently, a Port 4.0. These characterisations, introduced by Maritime Studies literature, are closely equivalent to the business model concept developed by the Strategic Management literature in the last decades. This research paper inquires on the influence that Industry 4.0 technologies might have on the adoption of more sophisticated business models by seaports, and the mechanisms through which this influence is driven: in particular the role that technology push and market pull mechanisms might play. To this end, it develops a conceptual model that aims to provide an explanation of the relationship between the adoption of Industry 4.0 technologies and the evolution of seaports' business models. This model is then evaluated against an exploratory case study on the port of Barcelona. Finally, the paper explores what would “smartness” mean in a seaport context.\n",

      "Operations and maintenance of Offshore Wind Turbines (OWTs) are challenging, with manual operators constantly exposed to hazardous environments. Due to the high task complexity associated with the OWT, the transition to unmanned solutions remains stagnant. Efforts toward unmanned operations have been observed using Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) and Unmanned Underwater Vehicles (UUVs) but are limited mostly to visual inspections only. Collaboration strategies between unmanned vehicles have introduced several opportunities that would enable unmanned operations for the OWT maintenance and repair activities. There have been many papers and reviews on collaborative UVs. However, most of the past papers reviewed collaborative UVs for surveillance purposes, search and rescue missions, and agricultural activities. This review aims to present the current capabilities of Unmanned Vehicles (UVs) used in OWT for Inspection, Maintenance, and Repair (IMR) operations. Strategies to implement collaborative UVs for complex tasks and their associated challenges are discussed together with the strategies to solve localization and navigation issues, prolong operation time, and establish effective communication within the OWT IMR operations. This paper also briefly discusses the potential failure modes for collaborative approaches and possible redundancy strategies to manage them. The collaborative strategies discussed herein will be of use to researchers and technology providers in identifying significant gaps that have hindered the implementation of full unmanned systems which have significant impacts towards the net zero strategy.\n",

      "Ship building, as an energy-intensive sector, produces significant amounts of air emissions, including greenhouse gases. Most research in greenhouse gas reductions from shipping concentrates on the reduction in emissions during the operational phase. However, as emissions during ship operation are reduced, the construction and dismantling phases of ships are becoming increasingly important in the assessment of the life-cycle impact of ships. In this study, priorities for a Turkish shipyard to become energy efficient were identified by means of a semi-structured questionnaire and an interview. This was undertaken using Fuzzy Multi-Criteria Decision-Making methods, including the Fuzzy Analytical Hierarchy Process and Fuzzy Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution, which are part of a proposed systematic and transdisciplinary Energy Management Framework and System. By applying Multi-Criteria Decision-Making methods, this framework supports the shipyard’s decision makers to make rational and optimized decisions regarding energy sectors within their activities. Applying the framework has significant potential to help achieve good product quality while reducing costs and environmental impacts, and can thereby enhance the sustainability of shipping. Moreover, the framework can boost both business and socio-economic perspectives for the shipyard, and improve its reputation and competitiveness, in alignment with achieving the Nationally Determined Contributions of States under the Paris Agreement.\n",

LNG carriers are inherently complex vessels, featuring a high degree of integration of their energy conversion systems, all operating under time and load varying mission profiles, making design decisions non-trivial. To this end, DNVGL COSSMOS (Complex Ship Systems Modelling and Simulation) in-house process modelling framework is used to build digital twins of the propulsion and cargo module of LNG carriers, modelling the entire energy conversion process from cargo tanks to useful energy required for propulsion, electricity and heat. Emphasis is given on reliquefaction systems and the improvement they provide in performance, comparing the currently available technologies and giving deeper insight for the Joule-Thomson systems. The overall ship system performance is improved by 5–15% along the low vessel speed range and 25–40% for the anchorage loaded port condition, when partial reliquefaction systems are considered, depending on the configuration they are compared to. Engine technology also plays an important role, with high-pressure engines exhibiting 3–10% better performance, depending on the reliquefaction technology coupled with, along the high vessel speed range, mainly because of their inherent better performance.\n",

However, challenges stemming from the demand for increasingly complex and high-quality products, hinder the widespread adoption of the conventional WAAM method for manufacturing industries. The development of artificial intelligence (AI) techniques may provide new opportunities to upgrade WAAM to the next generation. Hence, this paper provides a comprehensive review of the state-of-the-art research on AI techniques in WAAM. Firstly, we proposed a novel concept of intelligent wire arc additive manufacturing (IWAAM) and revealed the challenges of developing IWAAM. Secondly, an overview of the research progress of applying AI techniques to several aspects of the WAAM process chain, including fabrication process pre-design, online deposition control and offline parameter optimization is provided. Thirdly, the relevant machine learning algorithms, and the knowledge of corresponding AI techniques, are also reviewed in detail. Through reviewing the current research articles, issues of applying AI techniques to the WAAM process are presented and analysed. Finally, future research perspectives in terms of novel AI technique applications and AI technique enhancement are discussed. Through this systematic review, it is expected that WAAM may gradually develop into a smart/intelligent manufacturing technology in the context of Industry 4.0 through the adoption of AI techniques.\n",

      "Traditional approaches for visual perception and evaluation of river landscapes adopt on-site surveys or assessments through photographs. The former is expensive, hindering large-scale analyses, and it is conducted only on street-level or top-down imagery. The latter only reflects the subjective perception and also entails a laborious process. Addressing these challenges, this study proposes an alternative: a novel workflow for visual analysis of urban river landscapes by combining unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) oblique photography with computer vision (CV) and virtual reality (VR). The approach is demonstrated with an experiment on a section of the Grand Canal in China where UAV oblique panoramic imagery has been processed using semantic segmentation for visual evaluation with an index system we designed. Concurrent surveys, immersive and non-immersive VR, are used to evaluate these photos, with a total of 111 participants expressing their perceptions across multiple dimensions. Then, the relationship between the people’s subjective visual perception and the river landscape environment as seen by computers has been established. The results suggest that using this approach, rivers and surrounding landscapes can be analyzed automatically and efficiently, and the mean pixel accuracy (MPA) of the developed model is 90%, which advances state of the art. The results of this study can benefit urban planners in formulating riverside development policies, analyzing the perception of plans for a future scenario before an area is redeveloped, and the method can also aid relevant parties in having a macro understanding of the overall situation of the river as a basis for follow-up research. Due to simplicity, accuracy and effectiveness, this workflow is transferable and cost-effective for large-scale investigations of riverscapes and linear heritage. We openly release Semantic Riverscapes—the dataset we collected and processed, bridging another gap in the field.\n",

      "Autonomous systems are becoming ubiquitous and gaining momentum within the marine sector. Since the electrification of transport is happening simultaneously, autonomous marine vessels can reduce environmental impact, lower costs, and increase efficiency. Although close monitoring is still required to ensure safety, the ultimate goal is full autonomy. One major milestone is to develop a control system that is versatile enough to handle any weather and encounter that is also robust and reliable. Additionally, the control system must adhere to the International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea (COLREGs) for successful interaction with human sailors. Since the COLREGs were written for the human mind to interpret, they are written in ambiguous prose and therefore not machine-readable or verifiable. Due to these challenges and the wide variety of situations to be tackled, classical model-based approaches prove complicated to implement and computationally heavy. Within machine learning (ML), deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has shown great potential for a wide range of applications. The model-free and self-learning properties of DRL make it a promising candidate for autonomous vessels. In this work, a subset of the COLREGs is incorporated into a DRL-based path following and obstacle avoidance system using collision risk theory. The resulting autonomous agent dynamically interpolates between path following and COLREG-compliant collision avoidance in the training scenario, isolated encounter situations, and AIS-based simulations of real-world scenarios.\n",

      "Passenger ships facilitate the mobility of people at sea and are a significant revenue stream for societies. Simultaneously, they should meet safety standards. One of the main safety pillars is offering passengers a reliable emergency evacuation plan. The International Maritime Organization (IMO) has disseminated guidelines for passenger ships to enhance the evacuation process understanding. Although the number of passenger ships is rising worldwide, implementing IMO's guidelines, particularly advance evacuation analysis, is still a young research area. Hence, this paper attempts to study previous research on human evacuation from the IMO perspective to uncover the current position of the issued guidelines in the literature. Accordingly, this research reviews 115 research publications published in scientific journals, peer-reviewed conferences, and doctoral and master dissertations from January 1999 to August 2022. As a result, the authors present the literature review of state-of-the-art papers to establish a firm foundation of past research. After identifying gaps, breakthrough points are clarified for future research about the benefits of handling uncertainty in input parameters, understanding human evacuation behavior, mutual interrelation among evacuation factors, and potential adoption of digital technologies in human evacuation from passenger ships.\n",

      "Construction accounts for up to 25% of all occupational fatalities. About half are being struck by and caught-in/between objects or vehicles, resulting from insufficient or delayed detection of pedestrian workers. Research has proposed detecting visibility-related close calls in order to alarm the involved personnel and prevent negative consequences at the earliest possible time. This work has three objectives: First, a comprehensive synthesis on close call reporting processes and individual technologies. Second, a system focusing on (a) autonomous close call data generation from real-time proactive proximity detection and alerting technology and (b) cloud-based data processing and visualization in building information models at run time. Test results demonstrate that the developed system reaches purposes for decision making in safety management beyond the scope of existing detection and alarming devices. Third, guiding future research by outlining the role of proximity detection and alarming technology in developing autonomous safety systems for construction.\n",

      "This study analyzes the energy efficiency of ships based on ISO 19030, which is a standard for the measurement of changes in hull and propeller performance. The goal is to provide energy efficiency management with digital indicators that have not been easily provided. The ship navigation information platform (SNIP) is developed to determine the dynamic information of each ship, including the fuel consumption, ship speed, horsepower of the engine, rotation speed of the engine, wind direction, and wind speed. In addition, model test data and computational fluid dynamics (CFD) calculation data are applied to calculate the energy efficiency performance indicators. Finally, the relationship of the speed through water and the speed over ground enables us to modify the effects of the ocean currents. The results verify that these indicators can be used as a reference for performance monitoring and maintenance prediction of international maritime affairs.\n",

      "Recent and strict regulations in the maritime sector regarding exhaust gas emissions has led to an evolution of shipboard systems with a progressive increase of complexity, from the early utilization of electric propulsion to the realization of an integrated shipboard power system organized as a microgrid. Therefore, novel approaches, such as the model-based design, start to be experimented by industries to obtain multiphysics models able to study the impact of different designing solutions. In this context, this paper illustrates in detail the development of a multiphysics simulation framework, able to mimic the behaviour of a DC electric ship equipped with electric propulsion, rotating generators and battery energy storage systems. The simulation platform has been realized within the retrofitting project of a Ro-Ro Pax vessel, to size components and to validate control strategies before the system commissioning. It has been implemented on the Opal-RT simulator, as the core component of the future research infrastructure of the University of Genoa, which will include power converters, storage systems, and a ship bridge simulator. The proposed model includes the propulsion plant, characterized by propellers and ship dynamics, and the entire shipboard power system. Each component has been detailed together with its own regulators, such as the automatic voltage regulator of synchronous generators, the torque control of permanent magnet synchronous motors and the current control loop of power converters. The paper illustrates also details concerning the practical deployment of the proposed models within the real-time simulator, in order to share the computational effort among the available processor cores.\n",

      "Towards Design of Prognostics and Health Management Solutions for Maritime Assets\n",
      "With increase in competition between OEMs of maritime assets and operators alike, the need to maximize the productivity of an equipment and increase operational efficiency and reliability is increasingly stringent and challenging. Also, with the adoption of availability contracts, maritime OEMs are becoming directly interested in understanding the health of their assets in order to maximize profits and to minimize the risk of a system's failure. The key to address these challenges and needs is performance optimization. For this to be possible it is important to understand that system failure can induce downtime which will increase the total cost of ownership, therefore it is important by all means to minimize unscheduled maintenance. If the state of health or condition of a system, subsystem or component is known, condition-based maintenance can be carried out and system design optimization can be achieved thereby reducing total cost of ownership. With the increasing competition with regards to the maritime industry, it is important that the state of health of a component/sub-system/system/asset is known before a vessel embarks on a mission. Any breakdown or malfunction in any part of any system or subsystem on board vessel during the operation offshore will lead to large economic losses and sometimes cause accidents. For example, damages to the fuel oil system of vessel's main engine can result in huge downtime as a result of the vessel not being in operation. This paper presents a prognostic and health management (PHM) development process applied on a fuel oil system powering diesel engines typically used in various cruise and fishing vessels, dredgers, pipe laying vessels and large oil tankers. This process will hopefully enable future PHM solutions for maritime assets to be designed in a more formal and systematic way.\n",

      "The solution to mitigating risks associated with beyond Visual Line of Sight (BVLOS) operations of Unmanned Aerial System (UAS) generally focuses on the use of advanced Unmanned Traffic Management (UTM) systems. However, this solution does not take into account other uncooperative objects in the airspace. A more robust approach is to have UTM integrations coupled with onboard machine vision which is tied to automated collision avoidance systems. Future BVLOS regulations in urban situations may require robust embedded software that is capable of detecting air collision hazards in realtime at near and far ranges as uncooperative small aircraft and other unpredictable small objects with fast-changing and unscheduled trajectories pose significant hazards to UAS. This work presents the concept and initial prototyping of a Digital Twin to evaluate the capability of UAS mounted LiDAR to detect small-object air collision risks. A Digital Twin of the Port of Hamburg is augmented with typical port and harbour aerial hazards such as birds, drones, helicopters, and low flying aircraft. The use case scenarios are created in Maya and Unity, with Optix ray tracing of typical LiDAR imaging configurations used to replicate the cause and effect relationship between different LiDAR specifications and their response to small flying objects. Our results demonstrate the inhomogeneous point clouds generated at different spatial-temporal parts of the LiDAR scanning cycle and field of view. These results confirm the challenges of detecting small uncooperative objects by LiDAR.\n",

      "Ship motion has significant effects on certain maritime applications like offshore crane operation. In particular, the vertical heave motion is undesired for safe transferring, accurate positioning and subsea installation. In recent years, there have been growing tasks in utilizing ship motion data for online operation improvement based on the development of virtual simulation environment, digital twin and automatic remote-control systems. How to effectively utilize ship motion data is fundamental to these tasks. This paper presents a neural-network-based method to predict ship motion and use the prediction to improve active heave compensation (AHC) of offshore crane operation. A virtual prototype of the lifting system is developed including implementation of the proposed AHC algorithms. A multilayer perceptron model is trained to predict ship motion. By feeding the future motion of the ship into the controller, the lifting performance can be tested in the virtual environment and the result can be applied to its counterpart. Through simulation with measured sensor data, the proposed method is verified efficient in improving crane operation performance.\n",

Hence this paper presents an approach for a real time data acquisition system for a shipbuilding environment based on Auto-ID and real-time locating technologies. The system is linked to the design software. Thus product changes are announced immediately to the shopfloor what minimizes unnecessary work and time losses.\n",

Early prediction and proper corrosion monitoring can reduce economic losses. Traditional approaches used in corrosion prediction and detection are time-consuming and challenging to execute in inaccessible areas. Due to these reasons, artificial intelligence-based algorithms have become the most popular tools for researchers. This study discusses state-of-the-art artificial intelligence (AI) methods for marine-related corrosion prediction and detection: (1) predictive maintenance approaches and (2) computer vision and image processing approaches. Furthermore, a brief description of AI is described.

      "Hierarchical level fault detection and diagnosis of ship engine systems\n",
      "As smart ships are developed, research into engine management through remote monitoring and support from data collected at onshore control centers is being conducted. However, ship engine data collected from various sensors have high dimensions, large measurement errors, few labeled data, and insufficient amounts and quality of data, making it difficult to determine the condition of engines with complex failure modes under various operating environments. This study proposes a hierarchical level fault detection and diagnosis (HL-FDD) method that combines domain knowledge of ship engines and advanced data analysis techniques. The developed method extracts key features of reduced dimensions from the original variables (sensors) through an optimal hierarchical clustering and dimension-reduction model, allowing a hierarchy divided into the top (the entire system combining all features), middle (subsystems and feature sets), and bottom (components and sensors) levels. The reduced key features are used to generate robust regression models and dynamic thresholds (prediction intervals) according to the engine load, and dynamic thresholds determine whether the engine’s condition is normal or abnormal. The dynamic thresholds are able to automatically label abnormal conditions of the engine. Once anomalies are detected at the top level, the proposed method can sequentially search for data on features belonging to the middle and bottom hierarchies for detailed fault diagnosis to determine which engine subsystem or component(s) caused the engine fault(s). Actual data collected by ship operators verify the proposed method’s efficiency, reliability, and accuracy.\n",

      "Supply chains of fresh fruit must maintain a very narrow window of hygrothermal conditions after harvest. Any excursions outside this range can markedly lower the consumer acceptability of the fruit. However, the loss in fruit quality and marketability largely remains invisible to stakeholders throughout the supply chain. Here we developed a physics-based digital twin of citrus fruit to pinpoint when, why and to what extent fruit quality and marketability are reduced. Sensor data on 47 commercial shipments are thereby translated into actionable metrics for supply chain stakeholders by mapping the variability using principal component analysis. We unveiled a large spread (between 3% and 60%) in the shipments for different metrics of quality and marketability. Half of the shipments currently lie outside the ideal trade-off range between maintaining quality, killing fruit fly larvae and avoiding chilling injury. The digital twin technology opens the possibility to obtain the real-time coupling with sensor data to monitor food quality and marketability.\n",

The present study proposes the use of 2D Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) on contour images extracted from the dataset to recognize patterns that indicate early signs of defective behavior in the operational state of the vessel. Two parametric inquiries are presented aiming at determining the effect of the timeframe reflected by each contour image, and the degree of the inspected degradation on the efficacy of the models. The results provide insight in the applicability of 2D-CNN models utilizing low-frequency data in performing condition monitoring in ships. It was evinced that albeit the accuracy of the models intuitively increases as the degree of the inspected degradation also increases, the optimized instance of the 2D-CNN trained to inspect even a subtle degradation yielded an accuracy of 93%. Additionally, it is demonstrated that expanded timeframes used to create the contour images considerably improve the model's performance, as they integrate more information regarding the operational conditions per sample. In particular, the classifier fed contour images representing 1 month of operational data perfectly classified every sample on the test, yielding an accuracy of 100%.\n",

      "Hydrogen fueled Polymer Electrolyte Membrane Fuel Cells/Lithium-Ion Battery powertrains could be a promising solution for zero-local-emission shipping. The power allocation between PEMFC and LIB and their respective performance degradation play a crucial role in reducing the powertrain operating and maintenance costs. While several research works proposed energy management strategies to face these issues, a long-term operation optimization including the uncertainty in the input parameters of the model has not been extensively addressed. To this purpose, this study couples an operation optimization model of a PEMFC/LIB ferry propulsion system with a Monte-Carlo analysis to investigate the influence of PEMFC, LIB and hydrogen costs on the optimal operation of a hydrogen-powered ferry in the long-term. Hydrogen cost results to be the most influent parameter, in particular toward the end of the plant lifetime, when hydrogen consumption increases by up to 30%. Nevertheless, the variability of optimal ferry operation gradually decreases with the progressive PEMFC/LIB degradation.\n",

      "Digital twin (DT), machine learning, and industrial Internet of things (IIoT) provide great potential for the transformation of the container terminal from automation to intelligence. The production control in the loading and unloading process of automated container terminals (ACTs) involves complex situations, which puts forward high requirements for efficiency and safety. To realize the real-time optimization and security of the ACT, a framework integrating DT with the AdaBoost algorithm is proposed in this study. The framework is mainly composed of physical space, a data service platform, and virtual space, in which the twin space and service system constitute virtual space. In the proposed framework, a multidimensional and multiscale DT model in twin space is first built through a 3D MAX and U3D technology. Second, we introduce a random forest and XGBoost to compare with AdaBoost to select the best algorithm to train and optimize the DT mechanism model. Third, the experimental results show that the AdaBoost algorithm is better than others by comparing the performance indexes of model accuracy, root mean square error, interpretable variance, and fitting error. In addition, we implement empirical experiments by different scales to further evaluate the proposed framework. The experimental results show that the mode of the DT-based terminal operation has higher loading and unloading efficiency than that of the conventional terminal operation, increasing by 23.34% and 31.46% in small-scale and large-scale problems, respectively. Moreover, the visualization service provided by the DT system can monitor the status of automation equipment in real time to ensure the safety of operation.\n",

      "Ship hulls and propellers suffer from both mechanical defects and marine growth, which increase surface roughness and thus lead to significant power/speed penalties. A recent standard, ISO 19030:2016, aimed at establishing a transparent and accurate method to compare a vessel's performance to itself over time. However, the standard performance value, percentage speed difference Vdiff, is both vessel-specific and sensitive to operation point, most importantly vessel speed. The current paper thus proposes a new performance indicator, based on the concept of equivalent sand-grain roughness height ks, which would enable comparisons between vessels, increased accuracy for comparison of a vessel to itself over time, and calculation of penalties under operating conditions differing from past data (e.g. slow steaming). Sand-grain height ks is determined iteratively, through modelling roughness penalties on propulsive power (Granville's similarity law scaling), comparing modelled and measured penalties, and stopping the iterative process at a given tolerance on power penalty. This new performance indicator is applied to onboard-collected data from a Panamax tanker and two Roll-on/Roll-off sister vessels, yielding qualitative agreement with hull condition reported from diving inspections. Comparative advantages and limitations of ks are discussed in relation to the ISO 19030 performance value.\n",

Increased digitalization of manufacturing logistics processes and activities can facilitate more efficient coordination of the material and information flows for manufacturing operations in general.

This paper aims to investigate the challenges related to manufacturing logistics in ETO and how digital technologies can be applied to address them. Through a case study of a Norwegian shipyard, four main challenges related to manufacturing logistics are identified. Further, by reviewing recent literature on ETO and digitalization, the paper identifies specific applications of digital technologies in ETO manufacturing. Finally, by linking manufacturing logistics challenges to digitalization, the paper suggests four main features of digitalized manufacturing logistics in ETO: (i) seamless, digitalized information flow, (ii) identification and interconnectivity, (iii) digitalized operator support, and (iv) automated and autonomous material flow.

      "Digital innovation is increasingly mentioned as a potential key contributor to sustainability transitions. However, there has been little theoretical discussion of this topic. In this conceptual paper, the authors draw on literature on both sustainability transition studies and innovation studies to explore critically the contribution of digital innovation in sustainability transitions. They conceptualize transitions as fundamental changes in patterns of production and consumption, such as those relating to energy. Radical innovation leads to changes in the structure of socio-technical systems underlying such patterns, while incremental innovation contributes to maintaining the structure and current patterns. The authors suggest that digital innovations may contribute positively to sustainability transitions through couplings with sustainable innovations. They propose the following typology of such couplings: incremental twin innovations, sustainability supported digital innovations, digitally supported sustainable innovations, and radical twin innovations. Radical twin innovations may possess the greatest potential for sustainability transitions, as they are linked to structural change and thus open new pathways for sustainability transitions, whereas incremental twin innovations merely optimize current unsustainable systems. The typology is illustrated with examples from shipping and from electricity systems, and some of the complexities of twin transitions encountered by researchers and practitioners alike are discussed.\n",

To obtain a safe and smooth three-dimensional path for an AUV in ocean currents and seabed obstacle environments, an improved compression factor particle swarm optimization algorithm is proposed. First, a three-dimensional seabed environment model and Lamb vortex current environment model are constructed. Second, by considering optimization objectives such as travel distance cost, seabed terrain constraints and ocean current constraints, a three-dimensional path planning mathematical model is constructed. Finally, an improved compression factor particle swarm optimization algorithm is proposed and applied to solve the multi-objective nonlinear optimization problem. To verify the optimization performance of the new algorithm, its optimization results are compared with those of other algorithms by minimizing the fitness value. The experimental results reveal that the improved compressed factor particle swarm optimal algorithm has better planning efficiency, path quality, and shorter planning time, which provides a new effective method for path planning of autonomous underwater vehicle.\n",

As such, diagnostic analytics is performed; a process that is typically constituted by fault detection, fault isolation, and fault identification. Although some efforts have been made to distinguish the faults and malfunctions (fault detection) that can occur in marine systems, the implementation of fault identification to provide a description of any considered fault type and its nature is still an unexplored area due to the lack of fault data. To overcome this, a methodology for the identification of anomalies in marine systems is presented in this paper. The proposed approach aims to analyse the implementation of time series imaging through the application of the first-order Markov chain in tandem with an analysis of both ResNet50V2 and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) as part of the image classification task. To highlight the performance of this methodology, anomalies have been simulated considering the power parameter of a diesel generator. Results demonstrated the potential of time series imaging and image classification approaches, as the Markov-CNN achieved an accuracy of 95% when performing the fault classification task.\n",

      "Being able to give real time on-board advice, without depending on extensive sets of measured data, is the ultimate goal of the digital twin concept. Ideally, the models used in a digital twin only rely on current in-service data, although they have been built using simulated and possibly some measured data. Working with just the 6-DOF motions of a ship, can the local sea state reliably be estimated using the digital twin concept? Does a general model exist to do so, without the need to measure or simulate the particular ship?\n",

      "Different fields have been thriving with the advents in mobile communication systems in recent years. These fields reap benefits of data collected by Internet of Things (IoT) in next generation (5G and 5BG) mobile networks. The IoT concept transforms different fields by providing large amount of data to be used in their operations.

      "In recent decades, we have witnessed great advances on the Internet of Things, mobile devices, sensor-based systems, and resulting big data infrastructures, which have gradually, yet fundamentally influenced the way people interact with and in the digital and physical world. Many human activities now not only operate in geographical (physical) space but also in cyberspace. Such changes have triggered a paradigm shift in geographic information science (GIScience), as cyberspace brings new perspectives for the roles played by spatial and temporal dimensions, e.g., the dilemma of placelessness and possible timelessness. As a discipline at the brink of even bigger changes made possible by machine learning and artificial intelligence, this paper highlights the challenges and opportunities associated with geographical space in relation to cyberspace, with a particular focus on data analytics and visualization, including extended AI capabilities and virtual reality representations. Consequently, we encourage the creation of synergies between the processing and analysis of geographical and cyber data to improve sustainability and solve complex problems with geospatial applications and other digital advancements in urban and environmental sciences.\n",

      "To achieve sustainable heritage conservation, preventive conservation has gradually taken precedence over curative conservation, because it can inhibit the damage caused by various environmental factors and maximizes the preservation life of the artifacts. Due to susceptibility to environmental factors, preventive conservation has been used in the conservation of movable wooden artifacts to further protect them. Recently, digital twin technology, as a concept that transcends reality, can be mapped in virtual space to reflect the full lifecycle process of the corresponding entity, which is a superior characteristic that makes it valued and researched for health monitoring and health management of heritages. This paper proposes a health management method mainly for preventive conservation of movable wooden artifacts, integrating digital twin technology into the health management process. Using the Quanzhou Ship as a typical representative, several important components of health management are specifically analyzed, such as the five-dimensional model of the digital twin, the data interaction process of the digital twin, and the identification and assessment of risks. In particular, the process of preventive conservation of the stern based on the digital twin is presented in detail. This method provides a basis for future preventive conservation of movable wooden artifacts and has implications for the use of digital twin technology in the field of heritage conservation, especially for movable wooden artifacts.\n",

      "The International Maritime Organization (IMO) has enforced stricter limits on the Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emission due to environment and climate concerns. Many measures have emerged to reduce GHG emission from shipping. However, the effectiveness and applicability of any measure depend on ship type, ship size, operational mode and the operating ocean environment. Estimation of ship fuel consumption and emission in actual shipping scenarios are fundamental input to evaluate the impacts of shipping on the environment and climate, and to evaluate the effect of new measures to reduce GHG emission. A model for estimating ship fuel consumption and emission, based on ship hydrodynamical models and machine learning techniques, utilizing information from Automatic Identification System (AIS), the ship information database and metocean data is presented in this paper. The model is able to estimate the ship fuel consumption at high computational speed by utilizing machine learning (ML) technology, to evaluate the effect of new measures to reduce GHG emission. The power consumption calculated by the combined model is compared with measurement data from two container ships and two bulk carriers for validation. This validation shows that the model can predict ship power consumption well.\n",

      "Blockchain can help edge IoT-enabled Maritime Transportation Systems (MTS) in solving its privacy and security problems. In this paper, a lightweight blockchain called LBlockchainE is designed for edge IoT-enabled MTS to guarantee the security of sensor data stored in an edge computing environment. To save the resources of edge servers on ship, a data placement strategy is proposed. To encourage edge servers to positively contribute to storing data generated by sensor devices, storage resource consumption is employed as an influencing parameter, and servers with abundant resources are selected for priority storage. The data placement strategy also takes care of the access delay between servers and selects the nodes with the least access and storage costs as the priority storage choice. LBlockchainE applies the low-energy-consumption characteristics of Proof of Stake to determine the ownership of bookkeeping rights through a small number of competitive calculations and the resources of the node. Experimental results indicate that compared with Ethereum, the consensus mechanism of LBlockchainE consumes less energy and occupies less storage space. On average, the new system uses 1.6% less time and consumes 78% less battery power compared with traditional blockchain systems. In comparison to the random storage, the best storage, and the optimal data storage strategies, the proposed strategy maintains the same message costs.\n",

      "Statistical modeling of Ship's hydrodynamic performance indicator\n",
      "The traditional method used to estimate the hydrodynamic performance of a ship uses either the model test results or one of the many empirical methods to estimate and observe the trend in fouling friction coefficient (ΔCF) over time. The biggest weakness of this method is that the model test results as well as the empirical methods used here is sometimes not well-fitted for the full-scale ship due to several reasons like scale effects and, therefore, this method may result in an inaccurate performance prediction. Moreover, in the case of a novel ship design, it would be nearly impossible to find a well-fitting empirical method. The current work establishes a new performance indicator, formulated in the form of generalized admiralty coefficient with displacement and speed exponents statistically estimated using the in-service data recorded onboard the ship itself. The current method completely removes the dependence on empirical methods or model test results for the performance prediction of ships. It is observed here that the performance predictions using the current method and the traditional method are based on the same underlying logic as well as the results obtained from both the methods are found to be in good agreement.\n",

      "A sensitivity study of vessel hydrodynamic model parameters\n",
      "In the recent decade, maritime and energy industries have realized the potential of using operational data in combination with a virtual replication of the real physical asset, termed the digital twin. The digital twin then serves as a platform for data management, asset monitoring, and inspection and maintenance management, featuring an improved basis for cost effective operations and future decision making in terms of e.g. life extension. The present paper deals with application of the digital twin concept in marine operations where it is essential to handle the inherent uncertainties of vessel performance by applying a model that can adapt to the real operating conditions. In this paper a case study is presented for identifying the most sensitive parameters in the vessel hydrodynamic model w.r.t. the vessel motion RAOs. The study also shows that the parametric sensitivity depends on the interesting vessel response parameter, wave direction and loading condition. A digital twin adaptive to various operational conditions may require parametric tuning of the numerical model. It is important to identify the correct parameter(s) for modification. A simplified and idealized case study is also carried out to test the requirements to a successful parameter identification for model tuning.\n",

      "For the welding cell in the manufacturing process of large excavation motor arm workpieces, a system framework, based on a digital twin welding robot cell, is proposed and constructed in order to optimize the robotic collaboration process of the welding workstation with digital twin technology. For the automated welding cell, combined with the actual robotic welding process, the physical entity was digitally modeled in 3D, and the twin welding robot operating posture process beats and other data were updated in real time, through real-time interactive data drive, to achieve real-time synchronization and faithful mapping of the virtual twin as well as 3D visualization and monitoring of the system. For the robot welding process in the arc welding operation process, a mathematical model of the kinematics of the welding robot was established, and an optimization method for the placement planning of the initial welding position of the robot base was proposed, with the goal of smooth operation of the robot arm joints, which assist in the process simulation verification of the welding process through the virtual twin scenario. The implementation and validation process of welding process optimization, based on this digital twin framework, is introduced with a moving arm robot welding example.\n",

      "Towards the uncertainty quantification of semi-empirical formulas applied to the added resistance of ships in waves of arbitrary heading\n",
      "The present paper examines a semi-empirical framework for the estimation of added resistance in arbitrary wave heading under consideration of uncertainty quantification. In this respect, the calibration of the formula’s parameter vector is conducted based on particle swarm optimization as well as a database of model test results comprising 25 different ships and around 1100 samples. In the first iteration, the minimization of reducible systematic uncertainty is of interest and the effect of four objective functions on prediction accuracy is evaluated. Moreover, two different parameter combinations were obtained for blunt (CB≥0.70) and slender-type ships. Conversely, the irreducible statistical uncertainty, i.e. the inherent noise of the experimental data, is taken into account by a quantile regression procedure. Applying this approach, a 90% prediction interval for the formula’s estimates is implemented using the skewed version of the superior loss function in the previous iteration. The practical relevance of an uncertainty estimate for the prediction of the added resistance is emphasized in the final part, in which the proposed approach is validated in regular waves against model test data and other well-established prediction methods. In general, the validation studies suggest satisfactory performance and reliability of the adapted semi-empirical formulation.\n",

      "An Outlook on the Future Marine Traffic Management System for Autonomous Ships\n",
      "In the shipping digitalisation process, the peak will be reached with the advent of a wholly autonomous and at the same time safe and reliable ship. Full autonomy could be obtained by two linked Artificial-Intelligence systems representing the ship navigator and the ship engineer that possess sensing and analysis skills, situational awareness, planning, and control capabilities. Many efforts have been made in developing onboard systems; however, the shore facilities are not ready yet to deal with these new technologies. The paper aims to present the innovative technologies and methodologies needed to develop a futuristic Vessel Traffic System. The proposed systems will aim at faultless data acquisition and processing, provide input to decision-making systems, and suggest evasive manoeuvre; to deal with hazards and systems failure without human intervention onboard. The system is composed of three different and interacting layers. The first is an artificially intelligent tool to detect and control autonomous ships, thanks to situation recognition and obstacle avoidance strategies. The second is an orchestration and management platform designed to coordinate the sensing/actuation infrastructure and the AI algorithms’ results made available by multiple ships, mustering edge, and distributed computing techniques to fulfil the specific harsh requirements of the sea environment. The final part is a holistic guidance-navigation-control framework to manage autonomous ships’ navigation in a crowded area. Eventually, a cyber-physical scenario, using both a ship digital-twin and a real model-scale ship, is suggested to test and validate the innovative system without the availability of a full-scale scenario.\n",

      "In the framework of Industry 4.0, simulation plays a key role in processing sensors data to predict the future behaviour of a complex system. Aiming to increase ship efficiency and safety, simulations can be used in normal conditions but also during an emergency. In this context, progressive flooding simulations can be applied onboard large passenger ships to support master decisions after a collision or grounding casualty. Among the methods present in literature, the techniques based on linearized differential equations have been recently proposed and tested in model-scale. Here, the effects of three different linearized techniques are studied on a large passenger ship. The main issues connected to different mathematical formulations are highlighted, to enhance the reliability of the onboard progressive flooding simulation and better exploit data collected by sensors to increase ship safety in the framework of Shipping 4.0.\n",

      "This article investigates the successful survival of the Onagawa nuclear power station during and after the 2011 Tohoku earthquake and tsunami. As a research method, a system approach investigation and analysis— CAST (Causal Analysis based on Systems Theoretic Accident Model and Processes)—is applied over the life cycle of Onagawa. The main aim of this study is to identify how seismic and tsunami disaster risk reduction was implemented in different stages of the Onagawa nuclear power station’s life cycle. It is found that three safety cultures were built and developed over its life cycle: a nuclear safety culture, an earthquake safety culture, and a tsunami safety culture. These three safety cultures played important roles in the non-failure and success of Onagawa in 2011. Furthermore, the operator of Onagawa, Tohoku EPCo has a dynamic approach and a strong leadership towards earthquake and tsunami risk mitigation in all life cycle stages; flexibility and voluntary safety actions have been in place at Tohoku EPCo and Onagawa . Nevertheless, the 2011 events strongly influenced the decision to decommission the Onagawa Unit 1 early, brought to attention the length of the decommissioning process (which will surpass the operation stage), the high costs involved, and tremendous challenges linked to the permanent storage of radioactive waste. The successful survival of the Onagawa emphasizes that in order to achieve energy security through the nuclear energy in Japan and elsewhere in the world, safety always needs to come first. Furthermore, it supports dynamic learning not only for the nuclear industry, but also for the oil and gas and maritime industries; particularly, those situated in earthquake and tsunami risk areas.\n",

      "Maritime Autonomous Surface Ships (MASS) have obtained wide attention in recent years, which is relied on their attractive socio-economic benefits and potential to improve safety. One of the main characteristics of MASS is that it can use perception information to replace Officers on Watch (OOW) to make different navigation decisions through expert and intelligent systems, so as to make navigation more intelligent, reliable and safer, which is mainly based on the Maritime Autonomous Navigation Decision-making System (MANDS). However, the state-of-the-art study lacks a systematic description and research on MANDS, and most of them mainly focus on solving a single navigation decision-making task, which is not aligned with the meaning of autonomous navigation. Therefore, this study develops a novel MANDS and installs it on a 300TEU intelligent container ship to successfully carry out real ship trials of autonomous navigation. In this paper, the definition of autonomous navigation is first proposed, which mainly contains four different navigation tasks, namely “Keep route”, “Route Optimization”, “Collision Avoidance”, “Return Back”. A well-designed architecture for MANDS is presented which includes corresponding decision-making models and communication interfaces with external systems. Furthermore, in order to realize the switching and deployment between different navigation tasks in the process of autonomous navigation, a novel hierarchical decision-making mechanism is proposed and analyzed, and finally the MANDS is integrated with perception system and ship control system respectively. Before the real ship trial, this system is tested and verified in a simulation-based environment which is composed of the electronic chart platform and ship motion simulator, we also design a scenario library for the testing work. At last, real ship trials of autonomous navigation for MANDS are carried out, which can convincingly prove the performance of MANDS. This study proposes a relative complete solution for autonomous navigation, including system modelling, integration and real ship trial. These findings offer new insight into the research of ship autonomous navigation and promote the improvement of ship intelligence and informatization level.\n",

      "Towards a circular maritime industry: Identifying strategy and technology solutions\n",
      "Shipping is considered one of the most energy-efficient modes, considering the amount of cargo that can be carried. On the other hand, the circular economy approach is not well-established in the maritime industry, which currently lags behind different transport modes. The maritime industry needs scientific support to “close the loop”, minimise waste and increase the revenue stream. Therefore, this study aims to address a critical gap in the maritime industry by first showing the understanding of the stakeholders and identifying suitable strategy and technology solutions that can fit the characteristics of the maritime industry. Moreover, the potential benefits of these solutions have been demonstrated through high-speed marine engine remanufacturing. A cost-benefit analysis has shown that remanufactured engine acquisition cost is nearly half of the cost of a new engine with similar operating performance and operating cost. This study is a novel contribution to maritime industry stakeholders to demonstrate the advantages of circular end-of-life applications.\n",

      "Assessment of Ship Fuel Consumption for Different Hull Roughness in Realistic Weather Conditions\n",
      "This paper presents the effect of hull roughness over 10 years of operation on ship performance. The numerical model is developed by coupling NavCad and Matlab to perform the computation and the data processing. On the basis of a given hull, an engine, and an optimized propeller, the performance of the ship is computed for eight cases of hull roughness according to the ITTC recommendations in both calm waters and different weather conditions along the ship route. The effect of both wind and waves is considered for computing the added ship resistance along the route, thus requiring more power than just only the added resistance in waves. This provides a more accurate estimation of the ship’s performance along the different sea states. Lastly, a weighted average of the main ship parameters is estimated to evaluate better the ship’s performance. According to this study, the fuel consumption in calm water can be increased by around 20% after 10 years of ship operation based on the level of hull roughness. However, in the same weather conditions along the ship route, the ship’s fuel consumption can be increased by 10% compared to the same trip with a clean hull.\n",

      "Exhaust gas flow takes a vital position in the assessment of ship exhaust emissions, and it is essential to develop a self-powered and robust exhaust gas flow sensor in such a harsh working environment. In this work, a bearing type triboelectric nanogenerator (B-TENG) for exhaust gas flow sensing is proposed. The rolling of the steel balls on PTFE film leads to an alternative current generated, which realizes self-powered gas flow sensing. The influence of ball materials and numbers is systematically studied, and the B-TENG with six steel balls is confirmed according to the test result. After design optimization, it is successfully applied to monitor the gas flow with the linear correlation coefficient higher than 0.998 and high output voltage from 25 to 106 V within the gas flow of 2.5–14 m/s. Further, the output voltage keeps stable at 70 V under particulate matter concentration of 50–120 mg/m3. And the output performance of the B-TENG after heating at 180 °C for 10 min is also surveyed. Moreover, the mean error of the gas flow velocity by the B-TENG and a commercial gas flow sensor is about 0.73%. The test result shows its robustness and promising perspective in exhaust gas flow sensing. Therefore, the present B-TENG has a great potential to apply for self-powered and robust exhaust gas flow monitoring towards Green Ship.\n",

      "An extreme value distribution method for the vertical bending moment (VBM) is developed using a reduced order model (ROM) based on CFD-FEM coupling. A post-Panamax containership is considered to be a subject model and for which experiment was performed in our previous study. In ROM, VBM for all the components, i.e., wave-induced, whipping, and springing components, are calculated separately and superimposed. The vessel motions and wave-induced components are estimated from transfer functions derived from nonlinear strip theory and later corrected using CFD-FEM coupling. The whipping component is evaluated using von Karman's momentum theory with proper adjustment to specific hull parameters and additionally corrected using CFD-FEM coupling. A new semi-empirical springing ROM is developed based on CFD-FEM coupled analysis and experimental results. A numerous number of irregular waves are generated for a severe short-term sea state using random numbers, for which VBM time series is compared between ROM and coupled CFD-FEM analysis. The effect of springing and whipping in calculating the extreme value distribution of VBM is described for different probability levels. The effect of consecutive bow-stern slamming is also discussed. The development of this method will aid to attain real-time shipload prediction without expensive computational costs due to coupled CFD-FEM.\n",

      "Market positioning, i.e., the competitiveness of European shipyards, depends a lot on the measures of continuously improving the business processes, therefore meeting the criteria of environmental protection and sustainable energy. Lean management enables ongoing improvements of all system processes by recognizing and removing the unnecessary costs of the same, i.e., those activities which do not contribute to the added value for the customer. In this paper, the authors research the magnitude of improvements in the shipbuilding sales process achieved by applying the Lean tool “Value Stream Mapping” (VSM). The example of analysing the informational stream of the studied European shipyard’s existing sales process, performed by implementing the VSM, has defined the measures to decrease the losses in the process, with an emphasis on waiting time in internal and external communication. Upon VSM of the future state, measuring improvements realised by applying key performance indicators began. Significant cost savings in the sales process and the simultaneous increase of productivity of the employees participating in those process activities have been noted, as well as the substantial growth in sales and the shipyard’s income.\n",

      "On the Detection of Thickness Loss in Ship Hull Structures Through Strain Sensing\n",
      "In recent years, interest has grown in the maritime sector towards transitioning from preventive to predictive maintenance procedures. In terms of hull structure maintenance, the incorporation of Structural Health Monitoring techniques has emerged as a leading option. The objective of this work is to move towards this direction by investigating the use of classical detection theory tools to detect corrosion-induced thickness loss in ship hull structures through strain measurements obtained from in-situ sensors. This is introduced to regions where this phenomenon is common, and candidate sensor locations are selected based on the ship’s structural arrangement. Strain response data are obtained using a detailed FE model, which is subjected to a quasi-static loading condition, specifically still water loading. Operational variability is accounted for by considering the cargo filling rates as beta-distributed random variables. A Monte Carlo Simulation is utilized to estimate the statistical structure of the response, for both the intact and damaged conditions. Based on that, their distributions are considered mean-shifted and Gaussian. Additionally, the very low coefficient of variation of the monitored static strains allows for the measurements to be considered as deterministic signals. Therefore, the tools offered by classical detection theory of deterministic signals within noise are applicable and were ultimately used to construct a detector, whose performance was evaluated on an indicative 10% thickness loss scenario.\n",

      "A sequential random forest for short-term vessel speed prediction\n",
      "Short-term vessel speed prediction is exceedingly crucial to various issues in maritime transport, notably in cases with high precision requirement, such as trajectory tracking and collision avoidance. The methods for speed prediction have successively experienced the evolution of empirical formulas, physics-based approaches and data-driven models. Compared to the other two pioneering methods, building the model from data-driven learning seems to be a more appropriate way for ever-larger vessels that entered service in recent years. However, owing to insufficient speed-related features that can be known in advance, such as the engine state and propeller propulsion, traditional data-driven models usually have poor generalization ability when facing new test data. In this paper, taking a case study of a 400,000 DWT ore carrier sailing between China and Brazil, we first provide comparisons of several widely-used data-driven models and select the framework of random forest as the basic. Then, by considering the hardship of directly utilizing real-time monitoring data, we creatively put forward a novel prediction model by introducing sequential data of last historical speed records to bring the potential information of engine state into model learning. Through comprehensive experiments, the superiority and robustness of the proposed model are demonstrated by comparing with other frequently-used time-series prediction methods.\n",

      "Evolution in design methodology for complex electric ships\n",
      "Modern ships are highly complex technological systems and have a long and resource-intensive development cycle. Moreover, the final design must comply with many specific technical and regulatory requirements while constraining the capital and operational expenditures. Decisions made during the early stages of design have a large impact on ship functionality and determine the overall configuration of the ship; the advanced computational resources available today can be used to change the traditional approach to ship design, significantly improving the data available for these early-stage decisions. Moreover, the new methodologies can improve the ability to assess the impact of innovative technologies such as those inherent in the complete electrification of ships, and can simultaneously allow visualization of a three-dimensional (3D) virtual prototype of the designs. In this article, a methodological approach is presented that exemplifies these advantages.\n",

      "Electrochemical energy, being a safe and clean renewable energy source, is gaining considerable attention in recent years. The electrochemical energy technologies available are numerous and the choice of technology is usually guided by heuristics. The paper presents a critical review and comparison of three competing electrochemical energy technologies (secondary batteries, fuel cells and flow batteries) based on various characterization criteria like energy & power densities, cost, weight, efficiency, controllability, reliability etc. A rational framework is proposed to characterize the technology best suited for a particular application to achieve the best energy utilization. The idea is posed as a constrained multi objective optimization of design, followed by choice based on gravimetric and volumetric cost comparison of the three systems under consideration. For various combinations of characterization criteria, optimal choice of technology for an extensive scope of power and energy is found using the proposed framework and presented as area plots for easy understanding. This framework is then used to examine the prospects and directions of improvement for emerging technologies. Discussions are presented using the example of Vanadium Redox Flow Battery (VRFB).\n",

In terms of total incidents in the shipping industry in the last five years, failures relating to the propulsion system represent the majority. Condition monitoring offers effective early detection of failure which translates to increased reliability and decreased maintenance costs. Current industrial practices are often limited to performance monitoring rather than condition monitoring. Special focus is afforded to how condition monitoring is implemented on board ships, which regulatory codes are relevant and the summary of state-of-the-art research in marine machinery. Moreover, operation and monitoring in extreme environmental conditions, such as the Arctic and Antarctic with ice impact on the propulsion has been discussed. The new developments, in particular, digital twin approaches in health and condition monitoring have been highlighted, considering its pros and cons and potential challenges.\n",

      "As the design complexity of modern maritime systems is increasing, the need for advanced and appropriate simulation technologies is higher than ever. Different subsystems such as shipboard power systems and maritime controllers are directly interlinked making system integration and testing a challenging task. Hardware-in-the-Loop (HIL) testing is an advantageous methodology used for the systematic testing of control systems regarding correct functioning, performance and reliability. In this work, we present a HIL testing methodology to verify a ship power management system (PMS). For this, an AC shipboard power system is modelled including all relevant components such as diesel engines, generators, circuit breakers and loads interfaced by the PMS. The model also includes local controllers like speed governors and automatic voltage regulators (AVRs). A functional PMS was developed and implemented emulating the behaviour of a real controller. The models are exported as Functional Mock-up Units (FMUs) which represent stand-alone simulators. As HIL testing testbed the Open Simulation Platform (OSP) environment is used. This standardized and open platform enables co-simulation and also provides HIL testing capabilities. The exported FMUs are connected via the OSP environment. A load-dependent start-stop scenario is carried out to validate the correct functioning of the PMS and the test setup.\n",

      "The scale and scope of global logistics systems make real-time visibility of individual assets in global logistics systems difficult. Aggregating global logistics data to a manageable level where interruptions and disruptions can be anticipated or resolved is high on the wish list of global logistics managers and decision makers. Asset tracking and condition visibility in global supply chains is also difficult because few standards or metrics have been assessed in a supply chain, particularly when new technology is introduced, such as unmanned aerial systems in global supply chains. In this paper, we describe the integration of an unmanned aerial system in a global logistics system, and the metrics used to assess the integrated system. We highlight the importance of supply chain process, business impact, societal and environmental sustainability metrics, in addition to economic and supply chain performance metrics, in evaluating the integrated system.\n",

      "The availability of detailed environmental hindcast data opens the door for virtual structural health monitoring; however, the impact of hindcast wave data selection on the results of such an approach have not been explored. While studies on the differences between wave models have been conducted in the past, extensions of these comparisons to resultant vessel response predictions and fatigue damage estimates are limited. At three separate geographical locations, this work compared hindcast wave data from NOAA's WAVEWATCH III (NWW3) Multigrid Production Hindcast, the EU's CMEMS Global Ocean Waves Analysis and Forecasting Product, and National Data Buoy Center buoys. In addition to comparisons of wave parameters at each location, the resultant heave, pitch, and vertical bending moment responses and fatigue damage of a destroyer-sized naval combatant, the DTMB 5415, were compared. The novelty of this work lies in its large scope, which calculated responses every 3 h for all of 2017 in 32 speed and heading combinations for each location and wave data source. The results show that differences between wave data sources propagated to the vessel response predictions. These differences were then amplified in the calculation of fatigue damage causing significant discrepancies between data sources after just one year.\n",

      "Here, we present the R&D project Real-Time Digital Twin for Boosting Performance of Seismic Operations, which aims at increasing the overall operational efficiency of seismic vessels through digitisation and automation. The cornerstone in this project is the development of a real-time digital twin (RTDT) — a sophisticated mathematical model and state estimator of all the in-sea seismic equipment, augmented with real-time measurements from the actual equipment. This provides users and systems on-board the vessel with a live digital representation of the state of the equipment during operations. By combining the RTDT with state-of-the-art methods in machine learning and control theory, the project will develop new advisory and automation systems that improve the efficiency of seismic survey operations, reduce the risk of equipment damage, improve health monitoring and fault detection systems, and improve the quality of the seismic data. This will lead to less unproductive time, reduced costs, reduced fuel consumption and reduced emissions for a given operational scope.\n",

      "Highly accurate motion prediction is critical to facilitate safe navigation and autonomous control of a ship. In this paper, a math-data integrated prediction (MDIP) model of ship maneuvering motion is newly developed by combining with mathematical and data-driven modules. The math part is identified by employing variable-order hydrodynamic derivatives which are derived from Taylor expansion. Using extended Kalman filter, an optimal-order mathematical prediction model is obtained. The data-driven part dwells on prediction residuals which are approximated by a least square-support vector machine. Furthermore, integration mechanisms are devised to cohere mathematical and data-driven models as a whole, by deploying summation and neural network approximation, respectively. By comparisons, it is verified that not only order selection but also math-data integration can enhance ship motion prediction accuracy, for which various maneuvering tests are analyzed. The results demonstrate that the proposed MDIP model using math-data integration offers much stronger generalization, thereby paving a new path for ship maneuvering motion prediction.\n",

      "Ship speed is one of the most fundamental parameters which influences ship design, the energy efficiency of its operation, and safety. Therefore, ship speed selection and prediction under various environmental and operational conditions are of great concern recently for optimizing ship design and operational performance. Among the different approaches that address the ship speed topic, data-driven methodologies and Artificial Neural Network (ANN) techniques are attracting widespread interest due to its efficiency, accuracy, robustness, flexibility, and fault tolerance. Consequently, this study investigates multiple ANN model sizes and architectures to determine the suitable network parameters for ship speed prediction. Thus, we have a good balance between the model’s prediction accuracy and computational complexity. For this study, a publicly-available high-quality operational dataset suitable for benchmarking the results is utilized. This analysis also includes the effect of the data quantity and sampling duration on the data correlation and the ANN performance. The results indicate that the proposed ANN model can accurately predict ship speed under real operational conditions with an error of less than 1 knot. Furthermore, it has been shown that the proposed model can help with the decision-making and optimization processes of voyages planning and execution.\n",

The underwater monitoring of the oceans and their surroundings is highly crucial from several perspectives, e.g., to unearth the hidden minerals/oils, to monitor the life of underwater species, military and rescue applications, surveillance of maritime borders, and predict tidal wave behaviors among others. The exploration and inspection activities of the underwater environment are mainly performed remotely by unmanned underwater vehicles or robots because human direct involvement in such a complex environment might not be a feasible option. Moreover, the recent maturity in digital automation and underwater drone technology along with the emergence and improvements in wireless, communication, and sensing technologies had already encouraged the research community to drive deep into this domain. Among several disruptive enabling technologies, Blockchain has emerged as a vital enabling technology to fulfil key requirements for secure data sharing, storage, process tracking, collaboration, and resource management.

      "The International Maritime Organisation focuses on decarbonising the operational phase of a ship's life cycle. However, shipbuilding contributes to a significant amount of greenhouse gas emissions and air pollutants and has negative impacts on society. Holistic and transdisciplinary studies of the shipbuilding energy sector are lacking and a holistic approach is needed to discuss the potential of measures and tools to improve the shipbuilding industry with zero emissions. This study is an interdisciplinary approach to provide trends, recommendations and policies for decarbonisation of the shipping industry from a life cycle perspective. Taking into account a holistic and transdisciplinary approach, the energy sector in shipbuilding is categorised into an energy supply system, an energy economic system and an energy ecosystem, and the main disciplines for improving energy efficiency and promoting “zero emissions” for shipyards are identified, measures and tools within each discipline are proposed, and their mitigation potential and key issues for improving energy efficiency and reducing air emissions from shipyard activities are discussed. The case study highlights the economic, environmental and sustainability benefits of implementing the proposed modern energy system in an Italian shipyard. Although there is no silver bullet to eliminate air emissions in the shipbuilding industry due to the complexity, the different reduction potentials, the costs and the relationship and interaction between measures and tools, the implementation of the energy management framework can accelerate the transition to a zero-emission shipbuilding industry.\n",

While aerial access infrastructure is widely accepted to be an essential part of a comprehensive sixth-generation (6G) network, underwater wireless communications (UWC), unfortunately, are neglected. This observation questions us about the maturity of UWC technologies and its potentials for 6G. First, we describe an overview of 6G access infrastructures, revealing the gaps concerning underserved spaces and services. Next, we investigate current developments of cutting-edge technologies that enable heterogeneous multiaccess UWCs. Furthermore, we introduce UWC-enabled application scenarios that possibly improve the popularity of 6G in aquatic environments. Then, we analyze a feasible approach for a UWC integration to complement the 6G infrastructures, achieving a fully comprehensive framework. Finally, open challenges are discussed to drive future studies toward the maturation of UWC.

This study further developed an expert questionnaire based on 25 evaluation indicators and evaluated the key indicators of smart port service quality and their causal relationships using the analytic hierarchy process (AHP) and decision making and trial evaluation laboratory (DEMATEL). The results of this study showed that the key smart port success factors are: (1) accurate and secure delivery of cargo; (2) accurate electronic document transfer; (3) rapid provision of port berths to shorten the turnover time of ships; (4) convenient and comprehensive logistics and customs procedures; (5) transparent information integration on a single platform; and (6) use of big data to arrange container transport. Causal relationships were found among the indicators, including the fact that \"convenient and comprehensive logistics and customs procedures\" was influenced by “accurate electronic document transfer,\" \"transparent information integration on a single platform,\" and \"use of big data to arrange container transport.\" The results of this study can help port operators and government agencies identify key success factors for smart ports.

      "Implementation of flue gas waste heat recovery is an effective way to improve the energy utilization of marine engines. This paper aims to model and optimize a marine four-stroke dual-fuel (DF) engine coupled with a flue gas waste heat recovery system. Firstly, the DF engine and waste heat recovery system were respectively modeled in GT-Power and Simulink environments and verified with experimental data. Then, a regression model was built using the response surface method, with the intake temperature, compression ratio, and pilot fuel injection timing as input parameters and parametric analysis was performed. Finally, multi-objective optimization of the waste heat recovery system was performed using a genetic algorithm. The result showed that the optimal solution is obtained when the intake temperature is 306.18 K, the geometric compression ratio is 14.4, and the pilot fuel injection timing is −16.68 °CA after the top dead center. The corresponding brake-specific fuel consumption was 155.18 g/kWh, reduced by 3.24%, and the power was 8025.62 kW, increased by 0.32%.

For this approach, wave conditions were retrieved from two wave hindcast models and a ship as a wave buoy assessment using motion data. The stress response calculated using the numerical model of the vessel and the three wave datasets is compared to strain measurements. Further comparisons include estimates of the accumulated fatigue damage at a midship bracket based on the same data sources. Sensitivity of the fatigue accumulation to the wave spectrum description and input errors in the wave data are assessed. Results show fatigue damage estimates calculated using wave hindcast data are in good agreement with values derived from strain measurements. However, in storm conditions, the agreement is poor. In contrast, damage estimates calculated using the wave data from ship as a wave buoy procedures better represent responses in storm conditions but significantly over-estimate damage accumulation in milder seaways. Sensitivity analyses show that uncertainty in hindcast wave parameters has a limited effect on fatigue damage calculations while wave spectrum shape is more significant.\n",

Forecasts of MASS′ trajectories and motions are fundamentally based on the vessel's mathematical manoeuvring model, which is also referred to as the hydrodynamic digital twin nowadays. Using the benchmark container ship KCS as an object of study, this paper adopts a 3-DOF modular-type manoeuvring (MMG) model to predict the vessel trajectories in calm water and under the presence of steady current and regular waves. The current effects are treated as additional ship over water speed, while the wave effects are considered by superimposing the mean second-order wave drift loads to the calm water hull hydrodynamics. Concurrently, selected manoeuvring cases including turning circle and zig-zag are solved using the unsteady Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (uRANS) equations based CFD method, where a hierarchy of overset grids is utilised to allow self-propulsion and active rudder steering. The computed vessel trajectories and velocities are compared with that predicted by the MMG model and show reasonable agreement. The wave loads experienced by the vessel when turning in waves are also analysed and discussed.\n",

      "Currently, most ships use internal combustion engines (ICEs) either as propulsion engines or generator sets. The growing concern in environmental protection along with the consequent international rule framework motivated shipowners and designers to replace conventional power systems in order to mitigate pollutant emissions. Therefore, manufacturers have made available on the market many technological solutions to use alternative fuels (Liquefied Natural Gas or LNG, methanol, etc.). However, the main energy source is still fossil fuel, so almost all the ICEs are made up of turbocharged diesel engines (TDEs). TDEs have still the potential to improve their efficiency and reduce fuel consumption and pollutant emissions. In particular, the interpretation of Industry 4.0 given by manufacturers enabled the installation of a robust network of sensors on TDEs, which is able to allow reliable power management systems and make ships much more efficient regarding operating costs (fuel consumption and maintenance) and environmental footprint. In this paper, a software tool that is capable of processing the in-live performance of TDEs is described. The great novelty consists in the ability to process all the information detected by the sensor network in-live and dynamically optimize TDEs’ operation, whereas the common practice involves the collection of performance data and their off-line processing.\n",

A key tactic for achieving carbon dioxide emission mitigation goals is Carbon dioxide capturing and sequestration, which is critical for the seamless changeover from the prevailing fossil-based power systems to more eco-friendly future energy systems. Among the carbon dioxide capturing techniques, post-combustion capture is the most practical method for retrofitting existing power plants although it result with 3–15 vol.% concentrated carbon dioxide gas stream. Chemical looping combustion capturing receives much attention receives much attention owing to its non-pollution nature and the yielding of highly concentrated carbon dioxide stream, up to 100%. This review also explores a variety of sequestration strategies, including geological carbon dioxide sequestration with multiple geological carbon dioxide storage sinks, mineral carbonation sequestration, as well as marine sequestration. The carbon dioxide transportation and the storage facilities comprising pressure vessels, pipelines, and cryogenic storage tanks are also discussed briefly. The Enhanced gas recovery, Enhanced water recovery, and Enhanced oil recovery, which rely on geologically stored carbon dioxide are also taken into account in this analysis as a part of the commercial-economic application of carbon dioxide capturing and sequestration. Along with the risk considerations related to the sequestration processes, the efficient exploitation of the sequestered carbon dioxide is delineated as a road map leading to future prospects. Concerns have been raised that the widespread adoption of carbon dioxide capturing and sequestration will likely be affected by the general public perceptions due to unawareness, along with potential leakage risks and the enormous capturing cost, which should be puzzled out for the effective uptake of carbon dioxide capturing and sequestration strategies.\n",

Non-linearities may include, for example, dynamic behavior variations due to changes of operating point or operating mode (e.g., discontinuous conduction mode, continuous conduction mode). This paper presents design guidelines for determining the NARX-ANN architecture and the dataset to be used in the training process. Dataset definition includes the choice of the perturbations for stimulating the aimed system behaviors and optimizations for dataset size reduction. The proposed approach is first derived for a dc-dc boost converter. To verify the generality of the proposed method, the same methodology is also applied to a Ćuk converter. In both cases, the proposed NARX-ANN modeling provided accurate results, with only limited deviations observed in the time-domain responses to step variations of duty-cycle and output current. The proposed model provided accurate small-signal behavior under different operating conditions. The validity of the approach is evaluated experimentally by considering a boost converter prototype.\n",

There are two main approaches in modeling: physics-based and data-driven, which are both covered in detail in this survey paper. The output from the simulations might not be optimal in terms of certain performance criteria such as energy consumption, fuel cost etc. Hence, it is vital to optimize the systems considering the efficient interaction between the components, to yield the optimal performance for the integrated vessel’s powertrain. In this paper, the optimization case studies, for the ship energy systems, will be divided in terms of a) optimal design (topology and sizing), b) optimal control and energy management strategies, c) combined optimal design and control. Tables that summarize the literature review outcomes will also be presented at the end of each section. The main outcome is that limited literature is available for optimizations of ship powertrains using data-driven models, especially surrogate models. Surrogate-assisted optimizations for integrated ship energy systems can yield optimal solutions at fast computational speeds, with sufficient accuracy, even for complex, nested, multi-level, multi-objective optimizations.\n",

      "A case study for the assessment of fuel savings using speed optimization\n",
      "Potential fuel savings using a speed optimization algorithm have been studied for two case vessels in four different seasons at three ship speeds. Up to 6% fuel savings were observed. It was found that the savings are higher in seasons with a higher likelihood of severe weather conditions. Larger savings were observed at lower ship speeds which means, slow steaming combined with speed optimization can obtain even higher fuel savings and emission reduction. In addition to fuel saving, speed optimization can also ensure the timely arrival of vessels in harsh weather conditions. A methodology has been presented to optimize ship speed without altering the route; subject to constraints that voyage time is not exceeded and engine operating point is within the engine limits. A detailed analysis of wind and wave parameters on a transpacific route in four seasons has been presented to supplement the voyage performance analysis in different metocean conditions.\n",

      "Optimizing container terminal operations: a systematic review of operations research applications\n",
      "Operations research techniques have helped optimize container terminal operations over the past decades and have been a regular feature of maritime logistics and maritime supply chain literature in addition to being in practice at container terminals across the globe. Our systematic review collated through Scopus, 1768 papers published in the domain and analyzed them to find the main research clusters, and explore future research directions. Studies on both quayside and landside planning are grouped in five research clusters: discussing simulation, scheduling, automation, quayside operations, integrated operations and container transportation. In addition, the evolution of optimization techniques in planning container terminal operations is discussed, along with the suggested trajectory of the research agenda under each cluster. The analysis finds that genetic algorithms, integer linear programming and heuristics are the most widely used operations research techniques in container terminal optimization. While clusters of research in areas such as simulating container terminal operations, scheduling operations and automated terminals have received a great deal of attention, research focusing on integrated and dynamic operations has been scarce over the past years, suggesting a new area of contributions. The review proposes the application of methods such as neural network- and deep learning models related to artificial intelligence to widen our understanding of container terminal operations.\n",

      "Review of the uncertainties associated to hull girder hydroelastic response and wave load predictions\n",
      "This paper reviews the importance of uncertainties in hull girder loads influenced by flexible fluid structure interactions. The focus is on developments in the field of hydroelastic modelling, simulation and model tests of practical relevance to the prediction hull girder wave load predictions and their validation. It is concluded that whereas hydroelastic methods for use in design development and assessment become increasingly useful, challenges in realizing and modelling uncertainties can be attributed to: (1) the limitations of numerical methods to suitably model nonlinearities; (2) the ambiguity of model tests; and (3) the systematic use of data emerging from computational, model- or full-scale methods. An approach is recommended to assess the uncertainty in the hydroelastic responses to wave loading and an example is provided to demonstrate the application of the procedure.\n",

      "As maritime and military missions become more and more complex and multifactorial over the years, there has been a high interest in the research and development of (autonomous) unmanned underwater vehicles (UUVs). Latest efforts concern the modeling and simulation of UUVs’ collaboration in swarm formations, towards obtaining deeper insights related to the critical issues of cybersecurity and interoperability. The research topics, which are constantly emerging in this domain, are closely related to the communication, interoperability, and secure operation of UUVs, as well as to the volume, velocity, variety, and veracity of data transmitted in low bit-rate due to the medium, i.e., the water. This paper reports on specific research topics in the domain of UUVs, emphasizing interoperability and cybersecurity in swarms of UUVs in a military/search-and-rescue setting. The goal of this work is two-fold: a) to review existing methods and tools of semantic modeling and simulation for cybersecurity and interoperability on the Internet of Underwater Things (IoUT), b) to highlight open issues and challenges, towards developing a novel simulation approach to effectively support critical and life-saving decision-making of commanders of military and search-and-rescue operations.\n",

      "Data-driven probabilistic quantification and assessment of the prediction error model in damage detection applications\n",
      "Advances in computer hardware and sensor technologies have led to a surge in the use of data-driven modeling and machine learning for structural engineering applications, with Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) being one of them. Despite considerable interest, it remains a research topic due to the difficulty in accurately quantifying aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty in SHM systems. Sources of uncertainty are related to operational and environmental variability, as well as measurement noise and the model prediction error associated with the data used to train damage identification algorithms. In this work, the authors aim to explicitly quantify the statistical structure of model prediction error and assess its influence on the detection performance of strain-based SHM architectures under the existence of aleatoric variability. A structural beam, subjected to probabilistic static loading is used as the reference structure and strain measurements as the damage-sensitive features. Model prediction error is quantified explicitly using robust statistical tools through available laboratory observations and synthetic (Finite Element) data. Monte Carlo simulations enabled the forward propagation of uncertainty to the feature space to generate training data for three binary detectors (Likelihood Ratio Test, Quadratic Discriminant Analysis and Mahalanobis Distance), based on statistical pattern recognition. Detection performance was compared between the explicitly quantified prediction model error and the commonly assumed white Gaussian noise model, showcasing the influence of systematic error (bias) and correlation on the robustness of an SHM system using real-world data.\n",

      "Electrical cell-to-cell variations within large-scale battery systems — A novel characterization and modeling approach\n",
      "Digital twins for large-scale and investment-intensive Li-ion battery systems in marine and stationary applications have drawn increasing interest in recent years. Considering electrical cell-to-cell variations (CtCVs) within the underlying battery model of such a digital twin promises various advantages in the fields of model-based optimization and predictive maintenance. However, the existing approaches for both the characterization and modeling of CtCVs are unsuited for large-scale systems consisting of thousands of individual cells. In this context, this paper introduces a holistic tool chain comprising three main elements: First, a non-destructive method for the in-situ determination of resistance and capacity distributions within a battery system is presented. The method was evaluated on a commercial battery module for stationary applications consisting of 64 Ah pouch cells in 14s2p configuration. In the second step, the obtained distributions were used to parameterize a state-of-the-art multi-cell battery model, which allows the calculation of the voltage distribution within the system. The validation showed that the resulting model is able to calculate the voltage spread (Vcell,max(t)−Vcell,min(t)) with a mean average error of 1.1 mV for a 24 h load profile. In the third step, multivariate statistical analysis was used on the obtained parameters in order to simplify the original model and thereby reducing its computational demands. The simplification approach allows the calculation of envelope voltages curves within which a random cell can be found with a given probability. In comparison to the original model, the simplified model was able to represent the voltage extrema while reducing the computation time by a factor of 27. This renders the simplified model applicable for live digital twin applications for large-scale battery systems.\n",

      "The current work aims to strengthen the research of segmentation, detection, and tracking methods of stem cell image in the fields of regenerative medicine and tissue damage restoration. Firstly, based on the relevant theories of stem cell image segmentation, digital twins (DTs), and lightweight deep learning, a new phase contrast microscope is introduced through the research of optical microscope. Secondly, the results of DTs method and phase contrast imaging principle are compared in stem cell image segmentation and detection. Finally, a lightweight deep learning model is introduced in the segmentation and tracking of stem cell image to observe the gray value and mean value before and after stem cell image movement and stem cell division. The results show that phase contrast microscope can increase the phase contrast and amplitude difference of stem cell image and solve the problem of stem cell image segmentation to a certain extent. The detection results of DTs method are compared with phase contrast imaging principle. It indicates that not only can DTs method make the image contour more accurate and clearer, but also its accuracy, recall, and F1 score are 0.038, 0.024, and 0.043 higher than those of the phase contrast imaging method. The lightweight deep learning model is applied to the segmentation and tracking of stem cell image. It is found that the gray value and mean value of stem cell image before and after movement and stem cell division do not change significantly. Hence, the application of DTs and lightweight deep learning methods in the segmentation, detection, and tracking of stem cell image has great reference significance for the development of biology and medicine.\n",

      "Composite materials drive shafts attract particular interest in recent years. Their high strength, light weight and high fatigue and corrosion resistance make them suitable for high specification mechanical and marine applications. In the context of the present work, advanced finite element models that simulate the static and dynamic mechanical behaviour of composite drive shafts are combined with optimization algorithms in order to determine the optimum lay-up of a composite shaft according to the desired specifications. The composite shaft is also combined with metallic flanges and the performance of the combined system is also investigated.

      "Physical and Data-Driven Models Hybridisation for Modelling the Dynamic State of a Four-Stroke Marine Diesel Engine\n",
      "Accurate, reliable, and computationally inexpensive models of the dynamic state of combustion engines are a fundamental tool to investigate new engine designs, develop optimal control strategies, and monitor their performance. The use of those models would allow to improve the engine cost-efficiency trade-off, operational robustness, and environmental impact. To address this challenge, two state-of-the-art alternatives in literature exist. The first one is to develop high fidelity physical models (e.g., mean value engine, zero-dimensional, and one-dimensional models) exploiting the physical principles that regulate engine behaviour. The second one is to exploit historical data produced by the modern engine control and automation systems or by high-fidelity simulators to feed data-driven models (e.g., shallow and deep machine learning models) able to learn an accurate digital twin of the system without any prior knowledge. The main issues of the former approach are its complexity and the high (in some case prohibitive) computational requirements. While the main issues of the latter approach are the unpredictability of their behaviour (guarantees can be proved only for their average behaviour) and the need for large amount of historical data. In this work, following a recent promising line of research, we describe a modelling framework that is able to hybridise physical and data driven models, delivering a solution able to take the best of the two approaches, resulting in accurate, reliable, and computationally inexpensive models. In particular, we will focus on modelling the dynamic state of a four-stroke diesel engine testing the performance (both in terms of accuracy, reliability, and computational requirements) of this solution against state-of-the-art physical modelling approaches on real-world operational data.\n",

      "The main goal of this research was to investigate the psychosocial aspects that influence the acceptance of innovative technology in maritime transport and its impact on employees’ work-related wellbeing and absenteeism. In particular, this study focused on a device that had been introduced to sailors working in water public transportation in Venice. The theoretical framework included two integrated models: the TAM model, concerning acceptance of the technology, and the JD-R model, related to workers’ well-being. A two-wave study was conducted; at T1, a self-report questionnaire was administered to 122 sailors. Four months after its first administration (T2), objective data related to days of absenteeism were collected. The study showed that the perceived ease of use and the usefulness of the device influenced the workers’ intentions to use the technology and their motivational processes of work engagement, which was also related to social support. Work engagement impacted on work satisfaction and predicted the level of absenteeism (measured at Time 2). The implementation of a new technology may fail if transportation companies do not consider psychosocial factors that assist in the acceptance of such technology and promote the involvement of workers in the technological system.\n",

      "Digital twins of the mooring line tension for floating offshore wind turbines to improve monitoring, lifespan, and safety\n",
      "The number of installed floating offshore wind turbines (FOWTs) has doubled since 2017, quadrupling the total installed capacity, and is expected to increase significantly over the next decade. Consequently, there is a growing consideration towards the main challenges for FOWT projects: monitoring the system’s integrity, extending the lifespan of the components, and maintaining FOWTs safely at scale. Effectively and efficiently addressing these challenges would unlock the wide-scale deployment of FOWTs. In this work, we focus on one of the most critical components of the FOWTs, the Mooring Lines (MoLs), which are responsible for fixing the structure to the seabed. The primary mechanical failure mechanisms in MoLs are extreme load and fatigue, both of which are functions of the axial tension. An effective solution to detect long-term drifts in the mechanical response of the MoLs is to develop a Digital Twin (DT) able to accurately predict the behaviour of the healthy system to compare with the actual one. Moreover, we will develop another DT able to accurately predict the near future axial tension as an effective tool to improve the lifespan of the MoLs and the safety of FOWT maintenance operations. In fact, by changing the FOWT operational settings, according to the DT prediction, operators can increase the lifespan of the MoLs by reducing the stress and, additionally, in the case where FOWT operational maintenance is in progress, the prediction from the DT can serve as early safety warning to operators. Authors will leverage operational data collected from the world’s first commercial floating-wind farm [the Hywind Pilot Park (https://www.equinor.com/en/what-we-do/floating-wind/hywind-scotland.html.)] in 2018, to investigate the effectiveness of DTs for the prediction of the MoL axial tension for the two scenarios depicted above. The DTs will be developed using state-of-the-art data-driven methods, and results based on real operational data will support our proposal.\n",

      "Meteorological navigation by integrating metocean forecast data and ship performance models into an ecdis-like e-navigation prototype interface\n",
      "In the complex processes of route planning, voyage monitoring, and post-voyage analysis, a key element is the capability of merging metocean forecast data with the available knowledge of ship responses in the encountered environmental conditions. In this context, a prototype system has been implemented capable of integrating metocean models forecasts with ship specific performance data and models. The work is based on the exploitation of an open source ECDIS-like system originally developed in the e-Navigation framework. The resulting prototype system allows the uploading and visualization of metocean data, the consequent computation of fuel consumption along each analyzed route, and the evaluation of the encountered meteo-marine conditions on each route way point. This allows us to “effectively and deeply dig inside” the various layers of available metocean forecast data regarding atmospheric and marine conditions and evaluating their effects on ship performance indicators. The system could also be used to trigger route optimization algorithms and subsequently evaluate the results. All these functionalities are tailored in order to facilitate the “what-if” analysis in the route selection process performed by deck officers. Many of the added functionalities can be utilized also in a shore-based fleet monitoring and management center. A description is given of the modeling and visualization approaches that have been implemented. Their potentialities are illustrated through the discussion of some examples in Mediterranean navigation.\n",

      "Oil and gas offshore exploration and production (E & P) will remain necessary to meet increasing global energy demands. However, appraising and exploring these resources has a major impact on sustainability and faces many challenges. Improving the supply chain operations that support E&P activities presents opportunities to contribute to the United Nations (UN) Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), but relies on organizations being able to adopt new strategies and technology and, innovate their current business models. Business model innovation (BMI) has not been actively pursued in this industry, partially due to the traditional operation management and due to the complexity in changing established models or adopting full-fledged archetypes. Thus, the present study proposes a more flexible and granular approach to BMI by defining elements to be adopted rather than proposing business models archetypes. To define the elements, an application of systems engineering (SE) is adopted through a morphological analysis (MA). They are presented in morphological boxes in three dimensions—technology, organization, and the human element—inspired by sustainable business model (SBM) literature. The elements are proposed as “bricks” for BMI where they can be adopted and re-arranged as necessary, providing granularity and flexibility to facilitate BMI for organizations of varying sizes.\n",

      "Conventional fossil fuels are being substituted with alternative green fuels because of their greenhouse gas emissions and pollution problems, which pose a severe threat to the environment. Several studies have reported the usage of biodiesel and gaseous fuels in both single and dual-fuel modes. Gaseous fuels such as producer gas, biogas, syngas, and hydrogen produced from renewable biomass could potentially be used along with biodiesel in dual-fuel engines. Still, these are the least investigated in terms of their use as potential energy carriers. This review article encapsulates the viability as well as the impact of various gaseous fuels, including producer gas, biogas, compressed natural gas, liquefied petroleum gas, syngas, and hydrogen, in dual-fuel mode diesel engines with the aim of evaluating the performance, emission, and combustion behavior at various induction as well as operational parameters. Considering emission behaviors of diesel engines fueled with producer gas, biogas, compressed natural gas, and hydrogen, it is found that hydrocarbon and carbon monoxide emissions increase in the range 17.5–31.4% and 11.73–23.6%, respectively. On the contrary, oxide of nitrogen and smoke opacity tend to reduce from 14.3 to 18.2% and 21.4%36.5–63.7%, respectively. Moreover, there is a slight deterioration in performance characteristics for diesel engines fueled with producer gas, biogas, compressed natural gas, and hydrogen in the range of 2.1–8.84% for brake thermal efficiency, and 3.1–7.3% for brake-specific energy consumption. In addition, the combustion characteristics of gaseous fuels is also discussed in detail. Moreover, a SWOT analysis has been carried out with an emphasis on possibilities for usage of gaseous fuels in dual-fuel diesel engines. Finally, the limitations and perspectives of using gaseous fuels are also critically presented.\n",

This study reviewed 49 academic literatures to examine the port's carbon emissions estimation methodologies, quantitative research outcomes, and reduction techniques. The analysis results revealed: (1) Estimates of port carbon emissions frequently tend to underestimate actual emissions due to the omission of specific sources. (2) Inherent variances across ports present challenges in establishing a universally applicable estimation methodology. (3) Port carbon emissions reduction strategies involve operational optimization, dispatching, equipment transformation, and energy management. Future research directions were proposed, including comprehensive emissions source estimation, harmonization of estimation methodologies, equipment-integrated scheduling, port automation and electrification, and energy management.

However, the emerging methods are inadequate for complex space missions. Thus, the main objective of this study involves integrating S&R analysis in SysML-based space mission design. First, a framework for integrating S&R analysis in model-based space mission design is presented. Based on the characteristics of the development of complex space missions and the MBSE process, a multisystem collaborative failure analysis method is proposed to comprehensively identify the failure modes (FMs) of the entire system. Subsequently, an event-based analysis method integrating the process of functional architecture definition is proposed, which fills the identified gaps in model-based S&R analysis for mission-level systems. Based on the identified FMs and proposed criterion, the event tree can be mapped from the SysML activity diagram.

This work examines 103 academic articles on the topic of the perishable food supply chain published in various journals between 2001 and 2022. Research publications were selected from two reputed databases—Scopus and Web of Science. The study finds that the current trend in FCCM is toward sustainable FCCM, which offers financial, ecological, and social benefits. However, sustainable FCC practices are more common in wealthy nations but are still lacking in developing countries. High lead times, costs, waste, order returns, complaints, and dissatisfied consumers are the results of a fragmented market and the associated proliferation of chain intermediates.

Furthermore the deployment of a cutting-edge, integrated framework, incorporating the latest technological advances, that can of er the ability to capture, process and analyze vessels’ operational data in order to improve efficiency, sustainability, and rule compliance is presented. Particularly the conceptualization and materialization of a big data application suite that exploits the IoT (Internet of Things) and AI (Artificial Intelligence) advancements and technologies, to employ a “digital replica” of the en-route vessel is demonstrated. By collecting a multitude of features from on-board sensor installments, we present how we can effectively utilize these features, harvested in real time, in order to accurately assess and estimate the environmental footprint of the vessel by employing robust Fuel Oil Consumption (FOC) predictors. Then we describe in detail the streamlined procedure from data acquisition to model deployment, utilizing the proposed big data framework, in order to assess and estimate the emissions during the operational state of the vessel.

By mapping the knowledge base of 103 papers on intelligent ports, retrieved in late December 2022 from the Web of Science, this study conducted a roadmapping exercise using knowledge mapping findings, assisted by Bibliometrix, VoSviewer, and customized Python scripts. The three structural (intellectual, social, and conceptual) aspects of knowledge structure reveal the significance of the internet of things (IoT), the fourth industrial revolution (Industry 4.0), digitalization and supply chains, and the need for digital transformation alignment across various stakeholders with Industry 4.0 practices.

      "Structural health monitoring for corrosion induced thickness loss in marine plates subjected to random loads\n",
      "In the highly corrosive environment where marine structures operate, the current industry practice is to overcompensate for corrosion induced thickness loss (CITL) and replace any parts that score below specified allowable limits during scheduled maintenance. Hence, there would be immediate benefits from the implementation of a Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) system that would allow for predictive, condition-based maintenance. The objective of this study is to investigate and assess the effectiveness of state-of-the-art statistical pattern recognition (SPR) and machine learning (ML) methods in association with alternative sensor grid architectures as an SHM scheme for detecting CITL, under highly variable operational conditions. For this purpose, a simple rectangular plate at different corrosion levels (uniform and pitting) was considered as a reference structural element, which was subjected to a stochastic pressure load. Strain response data were produced using Finite Element (FE) simulations and were treated under a probabilistic framework. Elements from detection theory and ML were taken under consideration in order to construct alternative detectors and assess their performance.\n",

      "The industries using floating facilities such as FPSO and offshore wind turbine are increasing. Since these vessels have been fixed and operated in the installed area for a long period of time, they cannot be regularly docked, inspected and repaired as opposed to normal ship case, and limited to the inspection of the hull outer plates from under the water and the inspection of inside the tanks are conducted once every five years. These inspections involving visual inspections and thickness measurements at representative points, only examine the current state, and don’t evaluate quantitatively the future potential (remaining life) over the subsequent long operation period. To predict residual life in order to maintain the integrity of these structures, digital twin technology is proposed to realize this demand. This paper shows the method to develop digital twin assessment which solve the insufficiency of conventional monitoring and simulation method in order to utilize for risk-based inspection (RBI) and condition-based maintenance (CBM) to the operators.\n",

      "The smart ocean has been regarded as an integrated sensing, communication, and computing ecosystem developed for connecting marine objects in surface and underwater environments. The development of the smart ocean is expected to support a variety of marine applications and services such as resource exploration, marine disaster rescuing, and environment monitoring. However, the complex and dynamic marine environments and the limited network resources raise new challenges in marine communication and computing, especially for these computing-intensive and delay-sensitive tasks. Recently, the space–air–ground–sea integrated networks have been envisioned as a promising network framework to enhance the communication and computing performance. In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive survey on the integrated sensing, communication, and computing networks (ISCCNs) for smart oceans based on the collaboration of space–air–ground–sea networks from four domains (i.e., space layer, aerial layer, sea surface layer, and underwater layer), and five aspects (i.e., sensing-related, communication-related, computation-related, security-related, and application-related). Specifically, we provide the key technologies for the ISCCNs in smart oceans, and introduce the state-of-the-art marine sensing, communication, and computing paradigms. The emerging challenges with the potential solutions of the ISCCNs for smart oceans are illustrated to enable the intelligent services. Moreover, the new applications for the ISCCNs in smart oceans are discussed, and potential research directions in smart oceans are provided for future works.\n",

      "Sustainable Hybrid Marine Power Systems for Power Management Optimisation: A Review\n",
      "The increasing environmental concerns due to emissions from the shipping industry have accelerated the interest in developing sustainable energy sources and alternatives to traditional hydrocarbon fuel sources to reduce carbon emissions. Predominantly, a hybrid power system is used via a combination of alternative energy sources with hydrocarbon fuel due to the relatively small energy efficiency of the former as compared to the latter. For such a hybrid system to operate efficiently, the power management on the multiple power sources has to be optimised and the power requirements for different vessel types with varying loading operation profiles have to be understood. This can be achieved by using energy management systems (EMS) or power management systems (PMS) and control methods for hybrid marine power systems. This review paper focuses on the different EMSs and control strategies adopted to optimise power management as well as reduce fuel consumption and thus the carbon emission for hybrid vessel systems. This paper first presents the different commonly used hybrid propulsion systems, i.e., diesel–mechanical, diesel–electric, fully electric and other hybrid systems. Then, a comprehensive review of the different EMSs and control method strategies is carried out, followed by a comparison of the alternative energy sources to diesel power. Finally, the gaps, challenges and future works for hybrid systems are discussed.\n",

      "With the development of IoT technology, the digital twin has been applied in many fields. It is the key to realizing the integration of physical information space and an effective means for intelligent upgrading of products, providing a novel idea for the whole life cycle management of complex products. As a pillar industry at the national strategic level, the shipbuilding industry is in the stage of informatization transformation and upgrading and needs to improve its own competitiveness. The ship whole life cycle includes design, construction, operation, and maintenance, as well as scrapping and recycling, but each stage has a certain independence, which makes it prone to the problem of information islands. However, the current research on the product full lifecycle digital twin has not yet considered the impact of historical data of successive generation products on each stage of the current product lifecycle. To address the above issues, this paper firstly proposes the vertical–horizontal design idea from the perspective of the product whole life cycle and combining historical experience (vertical) with real-time data (horizontal) to realize the construction and evolution of digital twin models at all stages of the life cycle. Then, on the basis of the vertical–horizontal design idea, a framework for the ship whole life cycle digital twin is proposed. Finally, the operation mechanism of the framework is elaborated from the four stages of the ship life cycle, with a view to providing a reference for the transformation and upgrading of the future ship industry.\n",

      "Knowledge and data in cooperative modeling: Case studies on ship trajectory prediction\n",
      "A ship automation will be a key to the future maritime. In particular, ship dynamic models play an integral role. However, it is challenging to develop an accurate model readily. Recent studies proposed a physics-data cooperative model that predicts a future trajectory by compensating for position errors made by the physics-based model by using a machine learning model, which learns such a multiple-step-ahead compensation based on onboard sensor measurements. It seems to be promising to reduce effort in model development by exploiting observation data while having physics knowledge and a stable foundation in the model. However, it has been an open question “how much does the cooperative model benefit from physics knowledge and observation data?”. We tackled this key question experimentally. To investigate the benefit of the physics-based model and the data amount, by changing the accuracy of the physics-based model and the size of observation dataset, simulation and full-scale experiments were conducted. Results show that the accuracy of the physics-based model and the data amount were complementary to each other to some extent. A wide range of physics-based models worked as prior knowledge, however, too inaccurate models disturbed the training.\n",

In this paper, a total of 1051 papers from the Web of Science core collection for the period during 1992–2021 are collected as sample data. Based on the database, an analysis is conducted with CiteSpace software to map the knowledge regarding the field of green ports and explore the current research trends; the cooperation networks among countries (regions), institutions, and authors; and the evolution and mutation of keywords. The results indicate that the overall number of green port papers has increased over time. The countries with the highest numbers of papers published and the greatest influence are China and the United States, respectively. Additionally, the cooperative networks among authors, institutions, and countries are not mature enough and need to be strengthened further. Existing studies focus on the environmental impacts, evaluation, and construction of green ports. Recent trends indicate that researchers have become increasingly focused on reducing emissions, optimizing operations, evaluating policies, and identifying post-pandemic health issues associated with green ports. This study contributes to knowledge by assessing the state of the most significant studies published in the field of green port research, and the results contribute to a better understanding of green port research, which can further provide directions for the sustainable development of green ports.\n",

      "Multimodal transport is a critical component in developing the international trade economy, and logistics service providers are a critical component in multimodal transport. However, the recent COVID-19 pandemic has seriously affected the transport system, especially in light of the ongoing rise in transportation costs which has increased firm operating costs. Furthermore, the COVID-19 pandemic has severely influenced the economic sector, resulting in decreased growth. This research aims to determine the priorities of the most important factors for developing and improving multimodal transport compared to pre-COVID-19 and during the COVID-19 outbreak. This research consisted of two stages. The first stage used bibliometric analysis to define multimodal transport dimensions and criteria based on the previous and current literature studies on multimodal transport and used confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) to verify the relationship between factors and multimodal transport. The second stage used the fuzzy best-worst method (FBW) combined benefit, opportunity, cost and risk (BOCR) to prioritize the improvement and development of multimodal transport during the COVID-19 crisis, which considers the perspective of logistics service providers in Thailand. These factors, when identified, would help policymakers design more efficient policies to improve and solve multimodal transport problems mainly caused by strict public health measures during COVID-19.\n",

      "Detecting Shipping Container Impacts with Vertical Cell Guides inside Container Ships during Handling Operations\n",
      "Due to the mechanical nature of container handling operations, as well as natural factors, container and handling infrastructure suffers various types of damage during use, especially within the tight and enclosed environments of a ship’s hull. In this operational environment, it is critical to detect any sort of physical impacts between the vertical cell guides of the ship’s hull and the container. Currently, an inspection of impacts and evaluation of any consequences is performed manually, via visual inspection processes. This process is time-consuming and relies on the technical expertise of the personnel involved. In this paper, we propose a five-step impact-detection methodology (IDM), intended to detect only the most significant impact events based on acceleration data. We conducted real measurements in a container terminal using a sensory device placed on the spreader of the quay crane. The proposed solution identified an average of 12.8 container impacts with the vertical cell guides during common handling operations. In addition, the results indicate that the presented IDM can be used to recognize repeated impacts in the same space of each bay of the ship, and can be used as a decision support tool for predictive maintenance systems.\n",

Thruster–thruster and hull–thruster interactions are individually analysed by isolating each effect through a system of openwater, appended hull and free-running tests. Parametric studies are conducted for a range of advance ratios, thruster azimuth and hull drift angles. This study identifies the regimes where thruster–thruster and hull–thruster effects are significant. Results from this study are used to develop higher fidelity propulsion models and a digital twin of a tug, which can simulate the hydrodynamic behaviour and response of the vessel in real-time.\n",

      "Over the last decade, the evolution of autonomous automobiles based on artificial intelligence has increased rapidly with significant success. Naturally, this has caught the interest of the maritime industry and the development of autonomous vessels. However, unlike the highway, the ocean is considered a complex environment carrying unpredictable environmental forces, such as current, waves and wind-condition. For autonomous path-following and path-planning, particularly within the machine learning-field, Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) have generally been the favored approach. This follows from the fact that resulting models have demonstrated staggering performance. However, for practical implementations, Deep learning-based models are generally considered black box-solutions, and hence often introduce uncertainties in the operating domain. Therefore, in this paper an autonomous path-planner based on Supervised learning is proposed. Different Supervised learning models were investigated, and Gradient Boosting Regressor was found to be the most adequate model based on hyperparameter-tuning. The model was developed on constraints proposed by the class society DNV GL combined with International Regulations for Preventing Collision at Sea (COLREGs) rule 14 for collision-avoidance. Following this, the model was trained to design a suitable path based on parametrization of a cubic Bézier curve. To follow the parametrized path, a maneuvering-controller derived from the Maneuvering problem presented in Skjetne (2005) was applied. However, a drawback of Supervised learning is the necessity for large-scale training data. Hence, a digital twin of the own vessel was developed and utilized to generate sufficient training data. To demonstrate the performance of the autonomous path-planner, a number of simulation scenarios were introduced.\n",

      "Tactile sensing can provide sufficient cues concerning the geometry and texture of the contact in unknown environments. This paper proposes a semi-flexible triboelectric bionic whisker sensor (TBWS) as a novel scheme for robotic tactile perception. To be specific, it comprises power generation units (38mm in length, 18mm in width, and 10mm in thickness), octagonal plate, carbon fiber shaft (300mm in length, 1.5mm in diameter), shape memory alloy, and supporting parts. The octagonal plate hit the power generation units resulted from the carbon fiber shaft subjected to the external force, allowing to gene rate signals from the principle of via triboelectric and electrostatic induction. One another feature of the proposed sensors is that it is inspired by the structure of rat whisker follicles characterized by complex higher-order dynamics. Experimental result shows that TBWS can help robots accomplish autonomous work in complex environments. There is no doubt that the invention of sensor TBWS provides a new direction for robots’ future research.\n",

      "This paper studied a tactical liner shipping schedule design issue under sail and port time uncertainties, which is the determination of the planned arrival time at each port call as well as the punctuality rate and number of assigned ship on the route. A number of studies have tried to introduce the operational speed adjustment measure into this tactical schedule design issue, to alleviate the discrepancies between designed schedule and maritime practice. On the one hand, weather conditions can lead to speed loss phenomenon of ships, which may result in the failure of ships’ punctual arrivals. On the other hand, improving the ability of speed adjustment can decrease the late-arrival compensation, but increase the fuel consumption cost. Then, we formulated a machine learning-based liner shipping schedule design model aiming at above-mentioned two limitations on speed adjustment measure. And a machine learning-based approach has been designed, where the speed adjustment simulation, the neural network training and the reinforcement learning were included. Numerical experiments were conducted to validate our results and derive managerial insights, and then the applicability of machine learning method in shipping optimization issue has been confirmed.\n",

In this paper, we propose a method to analyze the behaviors of users in the VR training system to evaluate their knowledge about the contents and the performance to finish the trained task. First, the user status in the VR environment such as position, orientation, viewpoint, inputs, and timestamp is recorded. Then, we convert these user status data into spatial-temporal semantic trajectories by projecting the viewpoints into the semantic 3D object in the VR system. To speed up the projection and reduce the noises, the 3D targets are semantically generalized. Finally, an LSTM (long short-term memory)-based algorithm is created to classify the spatial-temporal semantic trajectories of user behaviors. The classification can be used to examine if the user is familiar with the training content. According to our experimental results, the proposed method based on the semantic projection can achieve 85% classification accuracy while the direct LSTM-based classification only has 64%.\n",

      "Dealing with novel and emerging threats in the maritime industry: The need for an alternative life - Cycle risk management framework\n",
      "Developments in the maritime industry, such as the increasing size of container and cruise ships, and the automated/autonomous ship concepts, yield technical and operational challenges throughout the life-cycle of ships. New interactions increase complexity, resulting in unforeseeable system states and risk fluctuations. Despite the development of approaches that address some of the limitations of current risk management, the sub-systems of the ship are mostly treated separately with only partial consideration of interactions between risk factors. The main goal of this paper is to introduce a novel framework for managing life-cycle risk in the maritime domain, where the ship is viewed as an integrated complex system that is subject to change throughout its life-cycle. The focus is on enhancing the adaptive capability of the system to respond to evolving dynamics and deal with unknown and emerging safety threats. In addition, to avoid potential problem shifting between life-cycle stages, interactions between risk factors and risk propagation are considered. In this context, a change in perspective for maritime safety is also proposed, based on the concept of biomimicry, considering that biological systems typically adapt in a dynamic environment to deal with emerging threats.\n",

The trajectory linearization control (TLC) method augmented by the neural network, linear extended state observer (LESO), and auxiliary system is used as the main control framework. The salient features of the presented strategy are as follows: in the guidance loop, a fuzzy predictor line-of-sight (FPLOS) guidance law is proposed to ensure that the USV effectively follows the given path, where the fuzzy method is introduced to adjust lookahead distance online, and thereby achieving convergence performance; in the control loop, we develop a practical robust path following controller based on enhanced TLC, in which the neural network and LESO are adopted to handle unmodeled dynamics and external disturbances, respectively. Meanwhile, a nonlinear tracking differentiator (NTD) is constructed to achieve satisfactory differential and filter performance. Then, the auxiliary system is incorporated into the controller design to handle rudder saturation. Using Lyapunov stability theory, the entire system is ensured to be uniformly ultimately bounded (UUB). Simulation comparisons illustrate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed strategy.\n",

      "A predictive digital twin of an autonomous ship is a continuously updated virtual representation of the physical ship that can be used to predict and prevent potential failures. By utilizing sensor data, diagnosis algorithms, and time series prediction methods, the digital twin can predict component failure inside the ship, allowing for early detection and mitigation. In this paper, the predictive digital twin is developed in three steps: (i) by describing the dynamics behaviour of the ships based on mechanistic models, (ii) by continuously updating the mechanistic models using data from sensor systems, and (iii) by predicting the faults and visualizing the results. To this end, the mechanistic model is derived from the first principles, while the updating algorithm is developed based on an adaptive exogenous Kalman filter. Experimental validation using a small ship platform is conducted, for which the results show the method can potentially increase safety and reliability of the ship during operation.\n",

      "In this paper, the wave-type microchannel cooling plates for marine large capacity battery thermal management are designed and tested. The cooling performances of the straight microchannel cooling plate (SMCP), the single-periodic wave microchannel cooling plate (SWMCP) and the double-periodic wave microchannel cooling plate (DWMCP) are experimentally investigated. The maximum temperature (Tmax) and temperature standard deviation (SD) of battery module during charge and discharge process are compared with the variation of the coolant inlet temperature (Tin), volume flow rate (qV) and the environmental relative humidity (RH). The experimental results demonstrate that decreasing Tin, increasing qV and decreasing RH would contribute to lower Tmax but higher SD. The cooling effectiveness of the wave-type microchannel cooling plates are validated by the reduced Tmax and the robustness in SD control. In particular, the newly designed DWMCP with the non-linear wave-type microchannel could relief the contradiction between cooling capacity and the temperature uniformity. For all the working conditions, the DWMCP could manage the Tmax and the SD below 41.5 °C and 0.96 °C, respectively.\n",

      "A Deep Learning-Based Fault Warning Model for Exhaust Temperature Prediction and Fault Warning of Marine Diesel Engine\n",
      "Marine diesel engines are essential for safe navigation. By predicting the operating conditions of diesel engines, the performance of marine diesel engines can be improved, failures can be prevented to reduce maintenance costs, and emissions can be controlled to protect the environment. To this end, this paper proposes a hybrid neural network (HNN) prediction model (CNN-BiLSTM-Attention) based on deep learning (DL) for predicting the exhaust gas temperature (EGT) of marine diesel engines. CNN is used to extract features from time-series data, BiLSTM is used to predict the time series through modeling, and Attention is used to improve the accuracy and robustness of fault prediction. Moreover, through comparison experiments with other neural network prediction models, it has been proven that the CNN-BiLSTM-Attention method is more accurate. This article also presents an approach to fault prediction by integrating the Mahalanobia distance and the mathematical model. Based on the Mahalanobia distance between the prediction result and the actual value, the function mapping method combined with the criterion is used to set the alarm value and threshold of the monitoring indicators, and the failure data set is used for experimental verification. The results indicate that the approach presented in this article can accurately realize the operating condition monitoring and fault early warning of marine diesel engines, which provides a new way of thinking for the research of fault early warning and health management of marine diesel engines.\n",

Therefore, we propose a few-shot fault diagnosis framework for supercharged boilers based on Siamese Neural Network(SNN). The variable analysis and two screening processes are introduced to train the model efficiently. The results show that when the number of training samples is 30 and the noise is −4 dB, the accuracy of Five-shot method is 45.17%, 26.56%, 19.31%, 18.32% and 8.43% higher than that of K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN), Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), respectively. When the number of training samples is 60, the accuracy difference between Five-shot and its main competitor CNN under the proportion of 30%, 20% and 10% new categories are 4.53%, 5.72% and 4.12%, respectively. When all 75 samples from different thermal systems are used for training, the accuracy of Five-shot method can reach 85% with the help of support set. The proposed few-shot fault diagnosis framework and variable screening method can be used as the preferred scheme for supercharged boilers fault diagnosis with limited fault data.\n",

A novel prognostic feature was developed that tracks diesel fuel injector damage based upon measured exhaust gas temperature for each cylinder, where prior work was limited to fault detection. The feature value is computed using a simple and accurate two-stage hybrid linear regression model for exhaust gas temperature that is based on engine thermodynamics and data from the engine controller. The model is shown to be accurate to within 10 percent at low exhaust temperature and within 5 percent at high exhaust temperature. The study showed that the feature has a strong correlation to injector leakage over the leakage range of 0–100 mm3 per cylinder stroke.

      "Research on digital twin based temperature field monitoring system for LNG storage tanks\n",
      "The temperature distribution is a critical indicator of the health condition of liquefied natural gas (LNG) storage tanks. Point measurements are the main method of traditional LNG tank temperature field monitoring. To obtain more abundant temperature data and realize the digital transformation of temperature field monitoring, an LNG tank temperature field monitoring system was constructed, which consists of a model layer, a data layer, and an application layer, by combining sensing data with digital twin (DT) technology. First, the temperature distribution of the LNG storage tank under working and leaking conditions was simulated, and the sensing monitoring network was constructed by combining Fiber Bragg Grating (FBG) sensor temperature-sensing experiments. Second, a finite element calculation model of the steady-state temperature field of an LNG storage tank was developed, and the twin model was generated by fusing the sensing data to realize the inversion from local sensing data to the whole temperature field. Finally, an LNG temperature field monitoring system based on the DT was constructed. Based on physical field leakage simulations performed with the Fluent software, the functions of visual interaction, construction splitting, temperature chart analysis, leakage diagnosis, and historical data management of the twin models were realized, which provided system building samples for digital monitoring of new LNG storage tanks.\n",

      "A new energy ship is being developed to address energy shortages and greenhouse gas emissions. New energy ships feature low operational costs and zero emissions. This study discusses the characteristics and development of solar-powered ships, wind-powered ships, fuel cell-powered ships, and new energy hybrid ships. Three important technologies are used for the power system of the new energy ship: new-energy spatio-temporal prediction, ship power scheduling, and Digital Twin (DT). Research shows that new energy spatio-temporal prediction reduces the uncertainty for a ship power system. Ship power scheduling technology guarantees safety and low-carbon operation for the ship.

      "The microgrid concept has evolved from the humble origins of simple remote electrification applications in rural environments to complex architectures. Microgrids are key enablers to the integration of higher penetrations of renewables in the energy sector (including electricity, heating, cooling, transport and industry). In addition to the local energy sources, energy storage systems and loads, the modern microgrid encompasses sophisticated energy and power management systems, peer-to-peer energy markets and digital technologies to support this energy transition. The microgrid concept has recently been applied to all energy sectors, in order to develop solutions that address pressing issues related to climate change and the decarbonization of these important sectors. This paper initially reviews novel applications in which the microgrid concept is being applied, from a detailed analysis of recent literature. This consists of a comprehensive analysis of the state of the art in shipboard microgrids, port microgrids, aircraft microgrids, airport microgrids and space microgrids. Future research directions are then presented, based on the authors’ perspectives on pushing the boundaries of microgrids further.\n",

      "Construction of a digital twin system for the blended-wing-body underwater glider\n",
      "The complexity of the marine environment adds unpredictable difficulties to researchers’ exploration. To study the application prospects of high-fidelity digital models to the maritime field, this study adopts the blended-wing-body underwater glider (BWBUG) as an example. A novel construction approach of an underwater simulation platform is proposed based on digital twin (DT) technology. The building process is described from the perspectives of geometry, physics, environment and behavior. Based on the Gazebo simulation platform, the proposed approach includes the construction of a high-fidelity model for underwater scenarios and is equipped with a vehicle body containing various sensors. Under the influence of ocean currents, the twin sensor data are integrated in the proportional–integral–derivative (PID) control algorithm, combined with a robot operating system (ROS), to achieve its pitch attitude control. The overshoot was reduced to at most 0.06% and the settling time is reduced to 29.5 s compared with the traditional PID. The results demonstrate that the proposed framework not only validates the implementability of control algorithms for unmanned systems in actual marine environment, but also has the potential for performance prediction, design improvement, and safety assessment in the next generation vehicle design process.\n",

      "Federated Learning for Condition Monitoring of Industrial Processes: A Review on Fault Diagnosis Methods, Challenges, and Prospects\n",
      "Condition monitoring (CM) of industrial processes is essential for reducing downtime and increasing productivity through accurate Condition-Based Maintenance (CBM) scheduling. Indeed, advanced intelligent learning systems for Fault Diagnosis (FD) make it possible to effectively isolate and identify the origins of faults. Proven smart industrial infrastructure technology enables FD to be a fully decentralized distributed computing task. To this end, such distribution among different regions/institutions, often subject to so-called data islanding, is limited to privacy, security risks, and industry competition due to the limitation of legal regulations or conflicts of interest. Therefore, Federated Learning (FL) is considered an efficient process of separating data from multiple participants to collaboratively train an intelligent and reliable FD model. As no comprehensive study has been introduced on this subject to date, as far as we know, such a review-based study is urgently needed. Within this scope, our work is devoted to reviewing recent advances in FL applications for process diagnostics, while FD methods, challenges, and future prospects are given special attention.\n",

Notable papers with direct and indirect applications to the COLAV subject are technically reviewed and compared. Critiques, challenges, and future directions are also identified.

      "Modeling and Optimization of Fuel-Mode Switching and Control Systems for Marine Dual-Fuel Engine\n",
      "The marine dual-fuel engine can switch between diesel and gas modes according to the requirements of sailing conditions, fuel cost, and other working conditions to make sure the ship is in the best operating condition. In fuel-mode switching in engines, problems such as unstable combustion and large speed fluctuations are prone to occur. However, there are some disadvantages, such as poor safety, environmental pollution, and easy damage to the engine, when the large, marine dual-fuel engine is directly tested on the bench. Therefore, in this paper, a joint simulation model of a dual-fuel engine is built using GT Power and MATLAB/Simulink to investigate the engine’s transient process of fuel-mode switching, and the conventional fuel PID(Proportion Integral Differential) control system is optimized using the cuckoo search (CS) algorithm. The simulation results show that the dual-fuel engine model has good accuracy, and the response in transient conditions meets the manufacturer’s requirements. In the process of switching from gas mode to diesel mode, due to the rapid change in fuel, the engine parameters, such as speed, fluctuate significantly, which is prone to safety accidents. In the process of switching from diesel to gas mode, because the fuel switching is gentle, all parameters are relatively stable, and the possibility of safety accidents is slight. The fuel PID control system optimized based on the cuckoo search algorithm has a better engine control effect than the traditional fuel control system.\n",

      "In recent years, shipborne emissions have become a growing environmental threat. The International Maritime Organization has implemented various rules and regulations to resolve this concern. The Ship Energy Efficiency Management Plan, Energy Efficiency Design Index, and Energy Efficiency Operational Indicator are examples of guidelines that increase energy efficiency and reduce shipborne emissions. The main engine shaft power (MESP) and fuel consumption (FC) are the critical components used in ship energy efficiency calculations. Errors in ship energy efficiency calculation methodologies are also caused by misinterpretation of these values. This study aims to predict the MESP and FC of a container ship with the help of data-driven methodologies utilizing actual voyage data to assist in the calculation process of the ship’s energy efficiency indexes appropriately. The algorithms’ prediction success was measured using the RMSE, MAE, and R2 error metrics. When the simulation results were analyzed, the Deep Neural Network and Bayes algorithms predicted MESP best with 0.000001 and 0.000002 RMSE, 0.000987 and 0.000991 MAE, and 0.999999 R2, respectively, while the Multiple-Linear Regression and Kernel Ridge algorithms estimated FC best with 0.000208 and 0.000216 RMSE, 0.001375 and 0.001471 MAE, and 0.999999 R2, respectively.\n",

      "A distributed physical architecture and data-based scheduling method for smart factory based on intelligent agents\n",
      "With the increasing demands for personalized customization, the characteristics of order gradually show dynamics and diversity, which bring new challenges to the production mode of traditional factory. In the context of industry 4.0, the emergence of advanced technologies has made the vision of transforming manufacturing system into smart factory stronger and stronger. However, the establishment of smart factory based on the original automatic workshop needs to consider two problems: one is how to redesign the physical architecture of the factory, and another is how to improve the scheduling performance of the factory. Therefore, this paper proposes a distributed physical architecture of smart factory based on intelligent agents (DPASF-IA). First, it is divided into multiple units according to different functions, namely processing unit, transportation unit, storage unit and decision-making unit. Then, the intelligent agent (IA) is designed for the building of these heterogeneous units. Moreover, in order to improve the scheduling performance of smart factory, a data-based scheduling algorithm is proposed based on reinforcement learning which realizes the high-quality management and improves the performance of scheduling. Meanwhile, combing with the proposed architecture and scheduling algorithm, a real-time scheduling mechanism is also proposed. Finally, a prototype system experimental platform for performance evaluation of scheduling is built according to the proposed DPASF-IA. The experimental results show that the proposed method can realize real-time scheduling and has good scheduling performance compared with other scheduling methods.\n",

      "Aiming at the demand of industrial instrument reading, this study proposes a method of industrial instrument classification and reading recognition based on YOLOv3. Given that industrial meters can be divided into pointer meters and digital meters according to the dial type, this method conducts a reading study for each of the two types of meters. Firstly, the YOLOv3 model is trained to recognize and detect the meter types and classify the meters according to the values of the obtained classes. The pointer meter uses a Hough circle to detect the dial, extracts the scale and the pointer, calculates the angle between the 0 scale line and the pointer, and obtains the reading of the pointer meter. The digital meter extracts the digits by finding the contours of the dial and the digit area and then uses a support vector machine (SVM) to identify the extracted digits and output the readings of the digital meter. Through the test, the mean average precision (mAP) of the recognition model in this study is 93.73%. The absolute error of pointer meter reading is less than 0.1 in general, and the maximum relative error is 0.35%. The accuracy of the digital meter reading is 99.7%. The proposed method can accurately read the value of the instrument and meet the needs of industrial production.\n",

The digitalization of business systems and the use of Information and Communication Technology have had a major impact across the spectrum of logistics and supply chain management activities. A wide range of developments have already taken place and the pace of change is quickening. We chart the principal stages in the development of computer-based and digital logistics systems that have changed fundamentally how goods, information, and finance flow through the supply chain. Contemporary developments covered include cloud-based systems, digital platforms, Artificial Intelligence, the Internet of Things, Digital Twins, the physical Internet, and Industry 4.0. These technologies not only have the potential to support logistics operations but may also act as disruptors to established approaches, practices, and logistics systems. This chapter discusses how these technological developments, in parallel with economic drivers such as cost saving, the desire for speed and accuracy in delivery, and the imperative for sustainable logistics systems, are contributing to the rapid changes and adaptations taking place. Although there are significant hurdles to widespread adoption, digitally enabled logistics is likely to continue to improve supply chain transparency, operational efficiency, and responsiveness.\n",

      "In the extremely competitive environment of shipping, minimizing shipping cost is the key factor for the survival and growth of shipping companies. However, stricter rules and regulations that aim at the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions published by the International Maritime Organization, force shipping companies to increase the operational efficiency of their fleet. The prediction of a ship speed in actual seas with a given power by its engine is the most important performance indicator and thus makes it the “holy grail” in pursuing better efficiency. Traditionally, tank model tests and semi-empirical formulas were the preferred solution for the aforementioned prediction and are still widely applied. However, currently, with the increased computational power that is widely available, novel and more sophisticated methods taking into consideration computational fluid dynamics (CFD) and machine learning (ML) algorithms are emerging. In this paper, we briefly present the different approaches in the prediction of a ship’s speed but focus on ML methods comparing a representative number of the latest data-driven models used in papers, to provide guidelines, discover trends and identify the challenges to be faced by researchers. From this comparison, we can distinguish that artificial neural networks (ANN), being used in 73.3% of the reviewed papers, dominate as the algorithm of choice. Researchers mostly rely on physical laws governing the phenomena in the crucial part of data preprocessing tasks. Lastly, most researchers rely on data acquisition systems installed at ships in order to achieve usable results.\n",

The aims of this article are to establish safety control structures at both the enterprise level and the government level, and to systematically analyze the problems in emergency management in Zhengzhou City.

      "As a critical node of the global transportation network, ports have great potential in promoting transportation emission reduction. Promoting the low-carbon transition of ports by using clean energy is effective. Using hydrogen energy in automated container terminals (ACTs) has become popular in port emission-reduction research. The research object is the main port equipment—the automated rail-mounted container gantry crane (ARMG). This research designs a staged investment decision-making scheme for ARMGs’ hydrogen energy transition. The Internet of Things (IoT) architecture in ACTs collects ARMG equipment operation and carbon emission data. It provides a basis for data acquisition in ARMGs’ hydrogen energy transition. Furthermore, ports can adopt big data technology to analyze the correlation between equipment operation and carbon emissions. Finally, the digital twin platform will visualize the ARMG equipment operation and carbon emission behavior to remote operators. These advanced technologies can achieve status monitoring and simulation prediction, which will support ARMGs’ hydrogen energy transition. However, the ARMGs’ hydrogen energy transition has a long cycle, large investment, and strong variability. Ports should make staged investment decisions based on the digital twin platform’s status monitoring and simulation prediction analysis results. Therefore, this research establishes an optimization model for ARMGs’ low-carbon transition investment decision based on the real options method, and analyzes the staged investment scale and timing of ARMGs’ hydrogen energy transition. The results provide a popularized decision-making scheme for the low-carbon transition of ports’ equipment, which could facilitate the low-carbon transition of ports’ equipment.\n",

      "Integrated Survivability analysis of naval platforms incorporates the domains of susceptibility, vulnerability and recoverability, measured temporally. These are accepted as key elements when holistically assessing naval platform survivability against threat scenarios. Conversely, traditional naval platform survivability assessment only considered the vulnerability domain or a combination of susceptibility and vulnerability. However, emphasis is now placed on the interdependence of susceptibility, vulnerability and recoverability. Unfortunately, there are shortcomings with historic survivability modelling and assessment capabilities pertaining to Integrated Survivability. This has resulted in the need to clearly define the concept of Integrated Survivability, and identify modelling requirements to assess platforms exposed to the threat environments. A naval platform Integrated Survivability assessment capability, derived from those survivability modelling requirements, will enable naval architects and mission planners to quantify the effects of platform survivability. Assessments will consider platform safety systems and survivability control measures, and changes to those systems and control measures. Outcomes from the assessments will contribute to platform configuration optimisation for resilience against the threat environment and enable mission success. This paper presents the need for an Integrated Survivability assessment capability, defining relevant terminology, and elucidating modelling requirements to develop such a capability.\n",

To investigate a speed prediction method of the largest bulk carriers ever constructed, we firstly compare several widely-used data-driven methods and then pick out the most appropriate model for the prediction task. Being as the input attributes of the data-driven models, the metocean data are collected from forecasting products and carefully cleaned up by data pre-processing steps. However, we have observed from literatures that the data for training are mostly collected from observational systems, such as the noon-reports, sensor measurements, on-board monitoring systems and reanalysis products, which may have certain differences with the data from forecasting systems. To figure out whether the data inconsistency problem will affect the model effectiveness on prediction, exhaustive experiments of a sensitivity study are carried out by utilizing observational data for training models while testing the prediction performance with forecasting data.\n",

This study utilizes modeling and simulation techniques to analyze the operational behaviors of the subsystems and confirm data communication between them. The targeted system in the study is a naval combat system (NCS), which is a typical type of defense cyber-physical system (CPS). Three types of models were designed for the simulation testing of the NCS: a combat-management model for simulating the overall computational activities, physical models to confirm the intrasubsystem behaviors, and data integration models to test the intersubsystem communications. These models are realized with the Model-View-ViewModel design pattern, which strongly facilitates graphical user interfaces being decoupled from model logic and data. We consider underwater combat scenarios as an application. Six significant physical subsystems within the NCS are simulated and tested: a ship-steering system, an inertial navigation system, a global navigation satellite system, a periscope, sonar systems, and a plotting board. We expect that the proposed work will play a principal role when analyzing the behaviors and communications of defense CPSs and providing an environment for functional testing as a digital twin.\n",

      "With the development of autonomous vehicles and intelligent infrastructure, the future waterborne transportation system participants will gradually evolve into certain degrees of autonomous intelligent agents, such as autonomous ships and intelligent ship locks. These intelligent agents will gradually become the main components of the waterborne transportation system. In this process, the varying development level of intelligence leads to individual diversity, and the overall traffic will also emerge the complexity. To ensure the safety and efficiency of the waterborne transportation system, it is necessary to study the organization, structure, and mode of the waterborne Transportation Systems(WTS), considering the diversity and complexity of the system. This paper proposed a concept of Autonomous WTS(AWTS), including the physical entity, the virtual entity, and the logical entity, describing the system’s capability, such as self-perception, self-organization, self-decision, self-control, self-adaption, and self-evolution. The AWTS contains five logical layers: the object layer, the cyberspace layer, the cognition layer, the decision-control layer, and the application layer. To investigate the advantages of AWTS, this paper demonstrated inland transportation in the bridge area as an example. The scenarios under different AWTS modes are simulated. The results indicate that traffic efficiency has been improved under AWTS modes, which shows the potential of using AWTS for improving traffic capacity and efficiency.\n",

      "This paper proposes an algorithm to design ship power systems in the preliminary design phase. As a case study, an embedded control is integrated into the preliminary design of the ship power system, at the level of Energy Management System (EMS). The embedded control developed for the algorithm aims for cost, availability, safety and emissions optimization from the top layer. At the power system level, a few alternatives are considered such as full electric propulsion and fuel-based energy producers. Different Key Performance Indicators (KPIs), Key Exception Indicators (KEIs) and Key Improvement Indicators (KIIs) for design are evaluated for cost optimization purposes. Power plant sizing results of an Offshore Supply Vessel based on batteries or Generating Sets (GENSETs) power contribution are extracted with the proposed pro-clean power plant design algorithm structure. The result of this first simplified simulation not just include a comparative evaluation between 7 different types of batteries for an all electric ship sizing but also a maximum and instantaneous Depth of Discharge (DoD) of the batteries among the OSV load profile register which could be used as a control bandwidth to consider at the EMS level. The presented algorithm structure is a preface for later hybrid systems power plant sizing generalization.\n",

      "The fourth industrial revolution, termed Industry 4.0, is characterised by an exponential transformation rate. As a result, workforces and companies must adapt to rapid changes, which prompted the development of new approaches to higher education, such as Education 4.0. However, despite its importance in enabling Industry 4.0 and related technologies, such as additive manufacturing and smart manufacturing, computer-aided design (CAD), computer-aided manufacturing (CAM), and computer-aided engineering (CAE) education has not undergone responsive changes to its delivery. Consequently, this study aims to support Industry 4.0 by identifying the necessary employability skills and enhancing CAD, CAM, and CAE education. This paper shows (i) the crucial role of higher education in equipping future engineers with the skills for Industry 4.0; (ii) the current state-of-the-art in computer-aided design; and (iii) proposes a novel adaptive approach to computer-aided design, manufacturing, and engineering. Indeed, the results reveal that the most effective teaching method evolves with the learner's ability. As such, the proposed Pedagogy 4.0 empowers students to adapt their learning experience. These findings provide novel insights into engineering education and may contribute to developing the next generation of engineers for Industry 4.0.\n",

      "Since 2017, NTNU’s Applied Underwater Robotics Laboratory has been developing an infrastructure for remote marine/subsea operations in Trondheim Fjord. The infrastructure, named the OceanLab subsea node, allows remote experimentation for three groups of assets: seabed infrastructure, surface or subsea vehicles/robots, and assets at remote experimentation sites. To achieve this task, a shoreside control room serves as a hub that enables efficient and diverse communication with assets in the field as well as with remote participants/operators. Remote experimentation has become more popular in recent years due to technological developments and convenience, the COVID-19 pandemic, and travel restrictions that were imposed. This situation has shown us that physical presence at the experimentation site is not necessarily the only option. Sharing of the infrastructure among different experts, which are geographically distributed, but participating in a single, local, real-time experiment, increases the level of expertise available and the efficiency of the operations. This paper also elaborates on the development of a virtual experimentation environment that includes simulators and digital twins of various marine vehicles, infrastructures, and the operational marine environment. By leveraging remote and virtual experimentation technologies, users and experts can achieve relevant results in a shorter time frame and at a reduced cost.\n",

      "Maritime industry is the artery of the global economy since it carries around 90% of the volume of global trade. However, the fierce environmental problems associated with human activities and economic development cannot be neglected. To systematically analyze the research status and development trend of the maritime industry, this paper collects and reviews literature from Elsevier ScienceDirect, Scopus, Web of Science, and Google Scholar databases related to green shipping management and green port construction. Future research directions are presented based on the analysis. The results show that green shipping management focus on solving practical emission reduction problems. Most work of green port construction establish mathematical optimization models aiming at minimizing total operation costs or maximizing profits. Designing efficient algorithms is a research hotspot in operation management. By comparing the technical measures, operational strategy, and market-based measures, we found technical innovation is the ultimate way for the maritime industry to realize net zero-emission. Support from governments and organizations is the insurance of green development. Future research perspectives include adopting high-tech technologies such as blockchain, big data, and artificial intelligent to improve operation efficiency and reduce emissions, providing more accurate suggestions for constructing green and smart ports, proposing multi-objective optimization models and highlighting the environmental target. This research can improve the existing theoretical frameworks and provide several future research directions for academia and practitioners.\n",

      "Predictive digital twins for autonomous surface vessels\n",
      "This paper presents an approach to improve the reliability and efficiency of autonomous surface vessels (ASV) by leveraging predictive digital twin and state estimation techniques. The predictive digital twin is based on a graphical model that shows the relationship between variables, and it is implemented and tested in an ASV based on a nonlinear discrete-time model and an adaptive exogenous Kalman filter to estimate the states and parameters associated with faults in the system. The state estimation method consists of a cascade of a nonlinear adaptive observer and a linearized adaptive Kalman filter, and the predictive algorithm is developed by creating a discrete-time state-space model from measured data and using the validated model to forecast the system response for a future time span. Experimental results in the Otter ASV developed by Maritime Robotics demonstrate the potential of the predictive digital twin as a decision support system for the predictive maintenance of ASVs.\n",

      "Reinforcement Learning and Automatic Control for Resilience of Maritime Container Ports\n",
      "Global logistics systems are in an unprecedented crisis from the pandemic, workforce disruptions, supply shortages, and demand surges. Shortages of goods and services, surges of demand, and an evolving workforce call for methods that address system resilience. Maritime ports in particular are vulnerable to these disruptions. The container stacking process is especially vulnerable, as it is a bottleneck in container management. This paper presents a simulation and reinforcement learning methodology for managing container stacking blocks. The container stacking problem is known to be difficult or impossible to optimize, with most ports using black box heuristic models. A simulation and reinforcement learning approach addresses these challenges. Simulation is an effective tool for and testing different inputs, parameter changes, noise, and changes to systems due to disruptive scenarios. Reinforcement learning is especially helpful for contexts in which traditional optimization is cost and computationally prohibitive, or where data is difficult to collect and analyze. This paper applies reinforcement learning with a mathematical simulation of the container stacking problem, achieving similar results to maritime ports. The results can be used to assess performance under disruptive scenarios, as well as to test new container storage configurations.\n",

      "The construction of hydrogen ships has emerged as the next area of research after the widespread usage of hydrogen storage tanks in fuel-cell vehicles. Marine hydrogen storage tanks are used differently than those used in the automobile industry because of the challenging sea conditions, which restrict their further use in ships. Current research is focused on finding ways to make marine hydrogen storage tanks stable and safe in these conditions. The use of hydrogen as a source of energy requires four main technologies: production, storage, transportation, and application. In this study, the fastening method for the hydrogen storage tank on the ship, node optimization, failure analysis, and real-time structural inspection of the connection node between the hydrogen storage tank and the ship are all covered. The failure processes and influencing variables of marine hydrogen storage tanks are distinct because in complex sea conditions, the fixed nodes of hydrogen storage tanks on ships are susceptible to hydrodynamic loads from waves and currents. The application of fiber optic nondestructive testing, digital twin technology, and intelligent sensing technology to the deteriorating performance and damage patterns of crucial ship connection nodes is covered in this study. It is anticipated that different technologies will combine to play a larger and larger role in the monitoring of ship life and the fatigue of hydrogen storage tank connecting nodes. The main challenges that marine hydrogen storage tanks face in complex sea conditions are summarized along with the current state of research. Suggestions are then made for the development of marine hydrogen storage tanks in the future, and a wide range of hydrogen energy applications are anticipated.\n",

      "Digital Twin of Shipbuilding Process in Shipyard 4.0\n",
      "Maximum digitalization is the current trend in industrial development. The digital industrial revolution has been underway for more than a dozen years. Industry 4.0 and the idea of digital twins (DT) are becoming the focus of virtually all industrial sectors. Some sectors are more predisposed to digitalization, while for others, the process is much more difficult. This mainly depends on the specific characteristics and susceptibility of a given industry, including the current degree of digitalization of companies, as well as the knowledge and mental readiness of employees. The individual characteristics of an industry are important. Shipbuilding is a traditional industry where the level of digitalization is still low. As a result, the efficiency of shipbuilding processes and the quality of ships built are not sufficiently controlled. The article addresses this problem, reviews work in the field of digitalization of shipbuilding processes, and identifies the needs and challenges in this area. The article proposes the concept of a DT system for the entire ship design and production process. Key areas of digitalization of the actual processes were defined, and a division was made into planning, monitoring, and process analysis activities. Special attention was paid to the area of dimensional quality control, and the dimensional quality management metasystem (DQMM) was introduced into the comprehensive DT system. The requirements were defined, and the limitations of the proposed solution were identified, taking into account a number of external factors, including the degree of readiness of the manufacturer—the shipyard. The developed DT system concept was tested using the example of the construction process of a simplified ship. Practical aspects of the implementation of the proposed solution, in particular, DQMM, were pointed out.\n",

      "Seaports are at the forefront of global trade networks, serving as hubs for maritime logistics and the transportation of goods and people. To meet the requirements of such networks, seaport authorities are investing in advanced technologies to enhance the efficiency and reliability of port infrastructures. This can be achieved through the digitalization and automation of core systems, aimed at optimizing the management and handling of both goods and people. Furthermore, a significant effort is being made towards a green energy transition at seaports, which can be supported through marine renewable sources. This promotes energy-mix diversification and autonomy, whilst reducing the noteworthy environmental footprint of seaport activities. By analyzing these pertinent topics under the scope of a review of container-terminal case studies, and these ports’ respective contexts, this paper seeks to identify pioneering smart seaports in the fields of automation, real-time management, connectivity and accessibility control. To foster the sustainable development of seaports, from an energy perspective, the potential integration with marine renewable-energy systems is considered, as well as their capabilities for meeting, even if only partially, the energy demands of seaports. By combining these fields, we attempt to construct a holistic proposal for a “model port” representing the expected evolution towards the seaports of the future.\n",

      "Sailing efficiency optimization and experimental validation of a Petrel long-range autonomous underwater vehicle\n",
      "Long-range autonomous underwater vehicles (LRAUVs) generally carry limited energy during observation missions, making it critical to enhance sailing efficiency through optimization design. Therefore, it is essential to understand the relationship between the shape parameters, motion modes, and sailing efficiency. This study proposes a LRAUV energy consumption model considering the variation in seawater density and drive loss, to obtain higher accuracy. In the optimization design, a surrogate model based on the response surface method is applied to establish the functional relationship between shape parameters, sailing parameters, and sailing efficiency. According to the optimization results, the AUV mode shows better efficiency in shallow sea, while the glider mode is more suitable for deep-sea operation. For the AUV mode, the applicable working band increases with the working time at fixed depth and/but decreases with the increase of the angle of attack at fixed depth. For the glider mode, the applicable working band increases the buoyancy compensation coefficient. The hotel load has less impact on the applicable working band for both modes. Based on the proposed method, a Petrel LRAUV with an optimized shape and sailing efficiency is developed, which can also serve as a reference for the preliminary design of other LRAUVs.\n",

      "This paper presents a new approach for estimating encountered wave elevation sequences by use of measured ship responses, where wind-waves and swell may come from different directions, i.e. bi-directional waves. The main assumption of the approach, making use of Prolate Spheroidal Wave Functions (PSWF), is that the wave field is represented by multi-directional irregular waves. Thus, combining available measured responses, the phases and amplitudes of the multi-directional irregular waves are derived as the solution, by which the wave profiles can be estimated. Numerical investigations using artificially generated response measurements (sway, heave, pitch, vertical bending moment) of a bulk carrier in uni-directional and bi-directional long-crested as well as short-crested sea states are made. It is shown that the present approach can accurately estimate wave elevation sequences in such sea states.\n",

      "Ships are exposed to added resistance caused by external environmental conditions, as well as the resistance due to the ship's form and the molecular features of the water. Since ship resistance is directly related to the fuel consumption and emission production of the ship, it is an essential obstacle to overcome for more efficient navigation. One of the basic approaches applied to reduce additional resistance is route optimization, and for a correct application, the effects of external environmental conditions should be well known. In this study, an artificial neural network model, in which nine external environmental conditions (current speed, current direction, swell height, swell direction, wave height, wave direction, significant wave height, wind angle, and wind speed) are used as input and ship resistance is used as output, was developed and the weights of external environmental conditions on the resistance were calculated. The results reveal that the two most dominant conditions affecting resistance are swell direction (33%) and wave direction (28%). Accordingly, it is suggested that ships should consider these two data more while making route optimization.\n",

The proposed framework (ONline Efficient Sources Transmission Optimizer - ONESTO) leverages state-of-the-art technologies and novel algorithms to automatically optimize transmissions under structural (e.g., available bandwidth, fixed packet overhead) and user-defined (e.g., maximum latency) constraints. In addition, ONESTO authenticates and encrypts the communication between the ship and the shore via mainstream free and open-source software components. Initially, we present the abstract mathematical formulation of the problem, with its assumptions, goal function, constraints, and significant quantities. Then, we introduce the architecture of a system capable of continuously estimating the compressibility, processing and transmission time of streaming data. Such estimations allow ONESTO to calculate and apply optimal parameters for achieving the best compression ratio. Lastly, using a prototypical implementation, we evaluate the system performance with a Class B ship simulator on two realistic use cases. Our experiments show an excellent compression ratio with maritime protocols (more than 40:1) and a limited latency impact, demonstrating the approach’s viability.\n",

We elaborate on the research status of inland river navigation technology in three aspects, i.e., situational awareness, event monitoring, and organizational optimization. The evolution and trend of technology development are summarized, and the deficiencies of supervision technology are analyzed. The research on the situation awareness of inland river shipping supervision makes adaptive progress with the development of advanced information perception technology, which capture ship physical appearance features using maritime radar technology and intelligent and now focus on multi-ship situation awareness combining multisource information and data mining method. As for event monitoring, it is mainly oriented to post-event analysis due to the lack of sensor equipment perception level, and it gradually develops towards in-event detection and pre-event prediction. The research on organizational optimization mainly includes space and time optimization of ship operation.In the future, the organizational optimization model should consider the impact of channel emergencies, which can promote the practical application of organizational operation and serve maritime affairs supervision better. We extract the corresponding key technologies in three aspects, i.e., construction of multi-mode integration and fusion perception network of inland waterway navigation system, holographic scene map, and intelligent control system. Oriented to the next generation of navigation systems, we propose a novel inland waterway transport management and control framework, named parallel control system. We summarize the key contents of system construction, i.e., physical modeling and dynamic coupling relationship modeling of inland river elements, parallel data set building and information mining, parallel supervision, and interactive visualization. We aim to use closed-loop interaction mechanisms between virtual and real transport systems based on digital twin technology to realize the efficient operation of the inland river navigation system.

This paper investigates the use of contract-based methods to address both design and verification challenges of control systems for autonomous vessels. The paper first presents a formal framework for specification of components and assume-guarantee contracts using the syntax of the Z3 automated theorem prover. Then, the paper proposes a methodology for contract-based verification using the formal framework. The methodology is divided into 4 steps: (1) Hazard identification between the autonomous vessel and the operative environment in order to define the top-level component and contract, (2) stepwise refinement of the top-level component into detailed sub-components and contracts, (3) definition of test setups for simulation-based testing to verify that components meet their contract, and (4) applying a recursive procedure for contracts-based system verification.

      "Augmented and Mixed Reality for Shipbuilding\n",
      "Industry 4.0 is paving the way for the automation of many industrial fields that can improve the efficiency of manufacturing processes. Such an improvement can be remarkable on industries that involve a relevant number of complex processes, which need to be optimized individually in order to increase their overall performance. Shipbuilding is one of such industrial fields that can benefit from the application of the principles of Industry 4.0 and from the use of the latest technologies. Among the different Industry 4.0 technologies, augmented reality (AR) and mixed reality (MR) can be especially helpful for enhancing shipbuilding tasks, since they can be applied to many of them, while providing useful and attractive visual interfaces that enable shipyard operators to receive information on the tasks they are working on and that allow them to interact with physical and virtual elements. This chapter first reviews the state of the art on the application of commercial and academic AR/MR solutions to shipbuilding. Moreover, the most relevant shipbuilding tasks to be enhanced with AR/MR and their challenges are analyzed. Furthermore, this chapter also details the latest and most promising AR and MR hardware, software, and communication architectures aimed at being deployed in shipyard workshops and on ships under construction. As a result, this chapter provides a thorough review of the most recent developments on the application of AR and MR to shipbuilding and includes useful guidelines for future developers.\n",

      "Physically plausible propeller noise prediction via recursive corrections leveraging prior knowledge and experimental data\n",
      "For propeller-driven vessels, cavitation is the most dominant noise source producing both structure-borne and radiated noise impacting wildlife, passenger comfort, and underwater warfare. Physically plausible and accurate predictions of the underwater radiated noise at design stage, i.e., for previously untested geometries and operating conditions, are fundamental for designing silent and efficient propellers. State-of-the-art predictive models are based on physical, data-driven, and hybrid approaches. Physical models (PMs) meet the need for physically plausible predictions but are either too computationally demanding or not accurate enough at design stage. Data-driven models (DDMs) are computationally inexpensive ad accurate on average but sometimes produce physically implausible results. Hybrid models (HMs) combine PMs and DDMs trying to take advantage of their strengths while limiting their weaknesses but state-of-the-art hybridisation strategies do not actually blend them, failing to achieve the HMs full potential. In this work, for the first time, we propose a novel HM that recursively correct a state-of-the-art PM by means of a DDM which simultaneously exploits the prior physical knowledge in the definition of its feature set and the data coming from a vast experimental campaign at the Emerson Cavitation Tunnel on the Meridian standard propeller series behind different severities of the axial wake. Results in different extrapolating conditions, i.e., extrapolation with respect to propeller rotational speed, wakefield, and geometry, will support our proposal both in terms of accuracy and physical plausibility.\n",

      "Switchgear Digitalization—Research Path, Status, and Future Work\n",
      "To keep pace with global energy efficiency trends and, in particular, emission reduction targets in the maritime sector, both onshore and maritime power distribution systems need to be adapted to the relevant new technologies and concepts. As an important link in the distribution chain, medium-voltage switchgear (MV) is expected to be stable and reliable while operating as efficiently as possible. Failures of MV equipment, while rare because the equipment must be safe to handle and use, have far-reaching consequences. The consequences of such failures, whether to the shore or marine power system, present risks to the entire power plant, so an accurate assessment of equipment condition is required to identify potential failures early. The solution is an emerging concept of digital switchgear, where the implementation of sensor technology and communication protocols enables effective condition monitoring, and the creation of a database that, when combined with machine learning algorithms, enables predictive maintenance and/or fault detection. This paper presents, step by step, the previous challenges, the current research (divided into predictive maintenance, condition monitoring, and fault detection categories), and the future directions in this field. The use of artificial intelligence is discussed to eliminate the disadvantage of manually interpreting operational data, and recommendations for future work are formulated, such as the need to standardize test procedures and data sets to train and compare different algorithms before they are used in practice.\n",

      "Autonomous surface vehicles need to be at least as safe as conventional vessels, if not safer, when navigating on waters. With a great deal of navigation algorithms for surface vessels out there, the safety of their produced paths is questionable, and, in most cases, complicated to assess and compare. Hence, this paper proposes a method for extended collision risk assessment for paths generated by autonomous navigation algorithms as follows: (1) static, dynamic, and historic risk factors are calculated; (2) individual risk value is determined using a fuzzy inference system; (3) the extended collision risk assessment (ECRA) score is acquired using a root-mean-square method. Finally, a comparison of the ECRA score of each path determines the path with the lowest risk. The validation results show that the proposed method is able to detect lower/higher risk scenarios and assign an adequate risk value in most cases. Risk reduction for cautious paths varies up to 8.43%, while risk increases for incautious paths—up to 57.98%. The results indicate that the method could be used for navigation algorithm evaluation and comparison with some improvements. This research also reveals several promising future directions and applications of the method.\n",

      "Since designing efficient ocean wave sensors for marine engineering is still a challenge, in this paper, a self-powered bionic coral wave sensor (BCWS) based on a triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG) is proposed, which aims at wave detection for marine engineering construction, marine resource development, and marine disaster warning. The BCWS consists of coral tentacles, buoyancy disc, spring, counterweight mechanism, and perceiving units (60mm in length, 10mm in width, and 1.5mm in thickness) with multi-modal motions and encapsulates inside the coral tentacles through flexible rubber joints. Meanwhile, the unique structure of BCWS can not only eliminate the influence of seawater on the sensor output performance but also realize the three-dimensional perception of wave information. The analysis of experimental data reveals that BCWS perceive wave direction, wave height, wave frequency, and wave period with millimeter accuracy. Therefore, this novel BCWS can provide an intelligent solution for modern marine engineering.\n",

      "The number of installed Floating Offshore Wind Turbines (FOWTs) has doubled since 2017, quadrupling the total installed capacity, and is expected to increase significantly over the next decade. Consequently, there is a growing consideration towards the main challenges for FOWT projects: monitoring the system’s integrity, extending the lifespan of the components, and maintaining FOWTs safely at scale. Effectively and efficiently addressing these challenges would unlock the wide-scale deployment of FOWTs. In this work, we focus on one of the most critical components of the FOWTs, the Mooring Lines (MoLs), which are responsible for fixing the structure to the seabed. The primary mechanical failure mechanisms in MoLs are extreme load and fatigue, both of which are functions of the axial tension. An effective solution to detect long term drifts in the mechanical response of the MoLs is to develop a Digital Twin (DT) able to accurately predict the behaviour of the healthy system to compare with the actual one. Authors will leverage operational data collected from the world’s first commercial floating wind farm (Hywind Pilot Park\n",

      "The fatigue strength of offshore structures operating in ocean must be determined to ensure their structural integrity. All the possible environmental conditions must be considered to accurately estimate the fatigue damage. Thus, analyses for estimation of fatigue damage can consume a significant amount of time as considering all the environmental conditions. Average sea-state method for fast estimation of fatigue damage was proposed in a previous study, and this method considers only one analysis for the representative values of significant wave height and modal period, considering wave occurrence probabilities. The proposed method can significantly reduce computation time required for fatigue analyses. In this study, the proposed method is applied to various wave occurrence probability distributions to determine the applicability to distribution forms. The seafastening structure which secures the topside on transportation vessel is used as the example model. The structural responses of seafastening structures are assessed by conducting coupled analyses considering the coupled behaviors of topside and vessel. The fatigue damage and life for each environmental probability distribution are estimated and compared with common solution. From the error comparisons, it is confirmed that the proposed method is suitable to be applied to a probability distribution form with a relatively small variance.\n",

This work presents research on the influence of added resistance on ship emissions and freight throughput. First, a methodology to assess the added resistance influence is shown. The procedure is applied to a roll on-roll off ship under two load conditions. Analyses are computed to value wind- and wave-added resistances for different seasons. An investigation on ship pollutant emissions for a whole route is performed. Moreover, the influence of added resistance on the ship freight throughput is analyzed. Finally, some relevant information is concluded. For instance, a difference of up to 53% in pollutant emission estimation is observed if added resistance is considered. Additionally, the navigation in added resistance conditions could lead to a freight loss of 18% per operational year.\n",

      "In recent years, online education in China has made considerable achievements. But there are also some problems: the teaching quality of online education is unsatisfactory; students’ online learning effects are frustrating, and students’ autonomous learning ability is poor. Based on analysis, teachers’ literacy and Internet technology are important factors restricting the online teaching reform, and online teaching easily falls into the dilemma of “shallow learning.” Digital twins can effectively realize the intelligent interconnection and interaction of the physical world and the information world, optimize the remote teaching process, and provide high-quality remote learning experience for learners. Based on this, the technology is used to the teaching of space geometry to help students understand it and improve their performance. First, the principle and advantages of digital twins are expounded. Second, the platform system based on digital twins is constructed. Then, the corresponding digital model is drawn by using the drawing function of MATLAB software, and the system based on virtual reality (VR) is established. Finally, the students of four classes of the same major are selected as the research subjects to test the teaching effect of advanced mathematics on the digital platform. The results show that students’ scores in the traditional classrooms are form 2.5 to 5.5 and their average score is 4.049, while the scores of the students in the digital twin classrooms are between 5.5 and 9.5 and their average score goes up to 7.986. This shows that students’ performance in the digital twin classrooms is 97.2%, higher than that in the traditional classrooms. A fully digitized spatial geometric model is implemented by using digital twins, and it can help students understand the mathematical theory of spatial analytic geometry, and their learning effect is greatly improved. This study provides a new direction for the application of new technologies in mathematics teaching.\n",

      "The shipbuilding industry has placed an emphasis on establishing digital twin prototypes to advance computational lifecycle analysis capabilities. However, material processing data is not currently included in simulations for structural performance, which could lead to inaccuracies. Integrated Computational Materials Engineering (ICME) techniques yield a path to solving this problem through linking digital information across multiple length scales in order to minimize the time and cost of physical testing needed for validation. This paper details the initial work of a larger materials-informed digital twin effort seeking to validate the need for fabrication inclusion in lifecycle analysis. First, the selection and fabrication of the “sister sample” specimens used for physical validation from a single plate of HSLA-100 steel. Second, the finite-element analysis (FEA)-based welding simulations of the reinforced dog-bone weldment. Third, comparison of predicted strain data from FEA simulations to two-dimensional (2D) strain maps using energy dispersive diffraction (EDD) techniques at the Cornell High-Energy Synchrotron Source (CHESS). The results showed high correlation between the measured EDD data and the FEA predictions, particularly for the high strain (>0.0015) fields of first principle strain vectors measured parallel to each welding pass. This computational validation is the first step towards validating the materials-informed digital twin method for increasing accuracy of structural analysis and fatigue lifecycle evaluation.\n",

Especially in complex data ecosystems with multiple decentralized data sources, it is hard to keep track of the processing operations once they are completed. When sharing such data between different researchers and other involved parties, poor traceability of processing steps may also obstruct this process. In this paper, we introduce a blockchain based data provenance information system, which enables decentralized sharing of this information. We then integrate this system into the decentralized data sources context and address trust and traceability issues in the network with an identity-based solution. Furthermore, the system’s performance is evaluated, and the concept is examined in a case study on the e-Maritime Integrated Reference Platform (eMIR).\n",

      "In recent years, the shipbuilding industry has been incorporating different technological innovations that adapt innovative techniques such as image correlation for 3D reconstruction, reduced order modeling methods for digital twins, pixel amplification techniques to measure vibrations, among other methodologies. The advancement of these methodologies help to obtain visual resources that allow a better understanding of a given phenomenon, which complements the results found numerically, analytically or experimentally. The present study collects data from different configurations of ship propulsion plants, which are based on real operating conditions. The operating conditions are given for fishing vessels; the \"navigation\" condition is selected as being the most frequent and the \"fishing operation\" as being the most energetically critical. These conditions are attached to the choice of the ship's propeller. For the propeller, the diameter, the number of blades and the length of the drive shaft from the main engine position to the propeller are considered. Three engine power levels (low, medium and high) are selected, represented by 300, 850 and 1300 HP engines. The aforementioned operating conditions are used to calculate the efficiency of the propulsion plant, obtaining several combinations. Furthermore, these configurations are expressed by means of Sankey diagrams and illustrations of the plant configurations in 3D using WebGL and Threejs libraries. Complementarily, these data are observed in an online simulator called \"ShipSim\", using \"html\" coding.\n",

      "Continuous contract based verification of updates in maritime shipboard equipment\n",
      "Modern control systems in the maritime domain are increasingly controlled by software systems and become subject to updates and configuration changes during operation. Moreover, with the shift to autonomous vessels and cars, these software-based systems are taking on more and more safety-critical tasks, so the risks associated with system failures are increasing. Unlike before, it becomes necessary to verify the continuously adapting modules of a vehicle not only before deployment, but to establish continuous verification capabilities during all phases of the product lifecycle, from the design to the system in operation. Hence, in case of an update, deviations from the expected behavior can be automatically detected and relevant measures can be initiated. In this work, a contract-based verification framework is presented that includes automatable and formally analyzable behavioral descriptors in form of assumption-guarantee contracts for all phases of the software lifecycle to provide static and dynamic verification capabilities alongside a dynamically changing system composition. By utilizing contractually defined behavior descriptions, classic test procedures, such as simulations, are supplemented by a formally testable level that is applied to all phases of the update process. A conceptual-deductive methodology was chosen, building on the identified requirements to develop an overarching update framework that adds contractual descriptions to the traditional development case. Based on the presented framework, the verifiable modification of a safety-critical software system is demonstrated. The approach is evaluated using a maritime collision-avoidance system and the verification steps are evaluated along the update process. The framework offers a novel approach to complement existing test procedures by enabling formal impact analysis and incremental verification of updates.\n",

      "Parameter identification of a model scale ship drive train\n",
      "Simulation models of the ship propulsion system play an increasingly important role, for instance in controller design and condition monitoring. However, creation of such simulation models requires significant time and effort. In this paper, the application of deterministic identification techniques on a DC-electric ship drive train is explored as an alternative for data-driven identification techniques that require extensive measured data sets collected over long periods of ship operation. First, a nonlinear and a linear simulation model that represent the dynamic behavior of the propulsion plant are developed, and the main parameters to be identified are defined. Then, a set of experiments on a model scale boat in the bollard pull condition are conducted using an ad hoc experimental setup and data acquisition system. Subsequently, various types of identification techniques are applied, aiming to determine the unknown model parameters. Eventually, a comparison is made between experimental and simulated results, using the different sets of the estimated parameters. The value of the demonstrated approaches lies in the fast determination of unknown system parameters. These parameters can be used in simulation models, which in turn can be used for various purposes such as system controller development and tuning. Furthermore, periodic determination of system parameters can support condition monitoring to detect faults or degradation of the system. The latter point directly deals with the condition-based maintenance issue; in fact, monitoring the propulsion plant parameters over time could allow for better management (and timing) of maintenance. Although the developed ideas are far from ready to be used on the full-scale, the authors believe that the methodologies are promising enough to be developed further towards a full-scale application.\n",

Unmanned autonomous intelligent systems (UAISs), as a physical form of artificial intelligence (AI), have gained significant attention from academia and industry. These systems have various applications in autonomous driving, logistics, area surveillance, and medical services. With the rapid evolution of information and communication technology (ICT), 5G and beyond-5G communication have enabled numerous intelligent applications through the comprehensive utilization of advanced NTN communication technology and artificial intelligence. To meet the demands of complex tasks in remote or communication-challenged areas, there is an urgent need for reliable, ultra-low latency communication networks to enable unmanned autonomous intelligent systems for applications such as localization, navigation, perception, decision-making, and motion planning. However, in remote areas, reliable communication coverage is not available, which poses a significant challenge for intelligent systems applications. The rapid development of non-terrestrial networks (NTNs) communication has shed new light on intelligent applications that require ubiquitous network connections in space, air, ground, and sea. However, challenges arise when using NTN technology in unmanned autonomous intelligent systems. Our research examines the advancements and obstacles in academic research and industry applications of NTN technology concerning UAIS, which is supported by unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) and other low-altitude platforms. Nevertheless, edge computing and cloud computing are crucial for unmanned autonomous intelligent systems, which also necessitate distributed computation architectures for computationally intensive tasks and massive data offloading.

      "A Methodological Approach to the Simulation of a Ship’s Electric Power System\n",
      "Modern ships are complex energy systems containing a large number of different elements. Each of these elements is simulated separately. Since all these models form a single system (ship), they are interdependent. The operating modes of some systems influence others, but at the same time, the work of all the systems should be aimed at fulfilling the basic functions of the ship. The work proposes a methodological approach to combining various systems of ships into a single complex model. This model allows combining models of ship systems of various levels (microlevel, macrolevel, metalevel, megalevel). The work provides examples of models of such multi-level energy systems. These are energy systems composed of an electric generator, a diesel engine, a propeller shaft, and algorithms used for operating the common parts of the ship’s electric power system and a piston wear process. Analytical, structural, numerical, and object-oriented models were made for these objects. Each of these particular models describes a limited class of problems, has characteristic properties, and a mathematical structure. The work shows how particular models can be interconnected using a set-theoretic description. Particular models are combined into macrolevel models, whose output parameters are quantities that are by no means related. The macrolevel models are interrelated using control models. Control models belong to the metalevel and allow for assigning settings and response thresholds to algorithms used in automation systems. Such a model (megalevel model) allows, ultimately, investigating the dynamics of the entire system as a whole and managing it.\n",

As one of the oldest industries, the shipping industry is accountable for transporting 80–90% of goods worldwide, consuming more fossil fuels, and emitting more pollution than ever. Many nations have deliberated policies to promote the shipping industry transition to a low-carbon economy. To investigate the role of various fiscal policies in supporting low-carbon transition, several panel regression models are designed to test their relationships based on data from the shipping industry in 22 Chinese provinces from 2007 to 2022. Then a vector autoregression model is developed to test their bidirectional dynamic relationships between fiscal policies and low-carbon transition. We find that there is an inverted U-shaped relationship between tax-based policies and low-carbon transition, transfer payment policies have an N-shaped effect on low-carbon transition, and the digital technology application plays a strong moderating role, reducing the negative impact of fiscal policies, and accelerating low-carbon transition in the shipping industry. These findings help policymakers how to make optimal fiscal policies to promote low-carbon transition in the shipping industry.\n",

At the same time, it is necessary to identify the main factors and tasks of creating transport and port infrastructure, building a modern fleet, and organizing fisheries and tourism in an environmentally sound manner. The purpose of the study is to consider the problems of anthropogenic influence for seaport facilities and to create a conceptual model of an environmental risk management system. The existing problems of Arctic ports and infrastructure are analyzed and existing business processes are considered, taking into account the peculiarities of their functioning in Arctic conditions. To systematize environmental assessments and establish dependencies between the main indicators describing the impact of port activities on elements of the natural environment, ontological domain engineering is proposed. It systematizes the basic terminology used within different subject areas of ecology and risks and allows one to visualize the relationships between elements of the natural environment, objects, port systems, their parameters and impact factors to assess the impact of the seaport on the natural environment. The results of ontological engineering (design and development of ontologies) in the field of risk management are presented.

      "E-Navigation: A Distributed Decision Support System With Extended Reality for Bridge and Ashore Seafarers\n",
      "A distributed decision support system has been developed to assist seafarers during several navigation tasks, for instance, in avoiding a collision with a detected obstacle in the sea and envisioning a future autonomous navigation system. In this paper, the decision support system is based on the results of a customized simulation model representing the ship’s behavior, including hydrodynamics, propulsion, and control effects. Sensors monitor and collect the parameters of the environment and the ship onboard. The telemetry and the calculated route are visualized on a wearable visor exploiting augmented reality. Such context information is also replicated ashore through a narrow-band satellite link using an IoT publish-subscribe communication paradigm to allow one or more remote seafarers to supervise the situation in a virtual reality environment. Overall, the potential of the proposed system is presented and discussed for application in the context of autonomous navigation.\n",

      "TwinPot: Digital Twin-assisted Honeypot for Cyber-Secure Smart Seaports\n",
      "The idea of next-generation ports has become more apparent in the last ten years - in response to the challenge posed by the rising demand for efficiency and the ever-increasing volume of goods. In this new era of intelligent infrastructure and facilities, it is evident that cyber-security has recently received the most significant attention from the seaport and maritime authorities, and it is a primary concern on the agenda of most ports. Traditional security solutions like firewalls and antivirus software can be applied to safeguard IoT and Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) from harmful entities. Nevertheless, security researchers can only watch, examine, and learn about the behaviors of attackers if these solutions operate more transparently. Herein, honeypots are potential solutions since they offer valuable information about the attackers. Honeypots can be virtual or physical. Virtual honeypots must be more realistic to entice attackers, necessitating better high-fidelity. To this end, Digital Twin (DT) technology can be employed to increase the complexity and simulation fidelity of the honeypots. Seaports can be attacked from both their existing devices and external devices at the same time. Existing intrusion detection mechanisms are insufficient to detect external attacks; therefore, the current systems cannot handle attacks at the desired level. DT and honeypot technologies can be used together to tackle them. Consequently, we suggest a DT-assisted honeypot, called TwinPot, for external attacks in smart seaports. Moreover, we propose an intelligent attack detection mechanism to handle different attack types using DT technology for internal attacks. Finally, we build an extensive smart seaport dataset for internal and external attacks using the MANSIM tool and two existing datasets to test the performance of our system. We show that under both simultaneous internal and external attacks on the system, our solution successfully detects internal and external attacks.\n",

Since the sensor networks continuously provide real-time data from the structure being monitored, they constitute a more realistic image of the actual status of the structure where the maintenance or repair work can be scheduled based on real requirements. This review is aimed at providing a wealth of knowledge from the working principles of sensors commonly used in SHM, to artificial-intelligence-based digital twin systems used in SHM and proposes a new asset management framework.

      "Physics-informed machine learning models for ship speed prediction\n",
      "This paper proposes a novel physics-informed machine learning method to build grey-box model (GBM) predicting ship speed for ocean crossing ships. In this method, the expected ship speed in calm water is first modeled by the physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) based on speed-power model tests. Then the eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) machine learning algorithm is integrated to estimate ship speed reduction under actual weather conditions. The proposed GBM has been compared against the traditional black-box model (BBM) using performance monitoring data from two ships. The results show that when the amount of data is sufficient for modeling, the GBM can increase the accuracy of speed prediction by about 30%. When data volume is limited, the GBM can also significantly improve the prediction results. Finally, the GBM is validated by checking its implementation for the ETA predictions of cross-Pacific or North Atlantic voyages. The highest cumulative error of sailing time estimated by the GBM is 5 h among all the study cases.\n",

      "SeaBil: Self-attention-weighted ultrashort-term deep learning prediction of ship maneuvering motion\n",
      "Accurate prediction of motion dynamics fundamentally promotes the autonomy of intelligent ships, but faces great challenges in modeling mechanism. In this paper, to establish data-driven recurrent mapping within ship motion dynamics, an ultrashort-term deep learning predictor is innovatively developed by elaborately creating a self-attention-weighted bidirectional long short-term memory (Bi-LSTM) network in conjunction with 1-dimensional convolution (Conv-1D), named SeaBil. To be specific, combined with the sliding-window technique, the Conv-1D is devised to convert 5-dimensional-input samples consisting of course angle, yaw rate, roll angle, total speed and rudder angle into 1-D-feature vectors, thereby extracting coupled feature maps within the current data-window. The Bi-LSTM is further deployed to recurrently learn forward and reverse feature maps of ship motion time-series data. Self-attention mechanism cascaded in the serial is employed to adaptively assign time-varying weights of sample instants within the current window such that the ultrashort-term prediction of course angle, yaw rate, roll angle and total speed can be achieved. Eventually, comprehensive comparisons to typical approaches using real-world samples demonstrate the superiority of SeaBil in terms of ultrashort-term prediction accuracy.\n",

      "Knowledge mapping analysis of resilient shipping network using CiteSpace\n",
      "The concept of resilience has been mentioned in many fields in recent years. In a broad sense, resilience refers to coping with risks. It generally refers to the system's ability to promptly adapt to impacts and changes and maintain functional and structural integrity. In the shipping sector, the resilience-related literature is, to a large extent, unstructured and scattered. This is because that different scholars have different starting points for studying resilience, which is embodied in different ways in various components of the shipping network. There are limited literature reviews to systematically relate research findings, streamline the evolution of frontier domains of research, and extract new trends in the fields. To this end, this article adopts a bibliometric knowledge mapping approach to review the literature on shipping network resilience systematically. The article uses CiteSpace to sort out the evolution of this field, classifying 176 related documents into seven key research topics. After analyzing the limitations and trends of the existing literature, the article proposes five research directions that may be more promising.\n",

      "A hierarchical digital twin of a Naval DC power system has been developed and experimentally verified. Similar to other state-of-the-art digital twins, this technology creates a digital replica of the physical system executed in real-time or faster, which can modify hardware controls. However, its advantage stems from distributing computational efforts by utilizing a hierarchical structure composed of lower-level digital twin blocks and a higher-level system digital twin. Each digital twin block is associated with a physical subsystem of the hardware and communicates with a singular system digital twin, which creates a system-level response. By extracting information from each level of the hierarchy, power system controls of the hardware were reconfigured autonomously. This hierarchical digital twin development offers several advantages over other digital twins, particularly in the field of naval power systems. The hierarchical structure allows for greater computational efficiency and scalability while the ability to autonomously reconfigure hardware controls offers increased flexibility and responsiveness. The hierarchical decomposition and models utilized were well aligned with the physical twin, as indicated by the maximum deviations between the developed digital twin hierarchy and the hardware.\n",

      "Identification of slamming events during ship navigation is typically based on the fulfillment of multiple conditions evaluated on sensor data. Alternatively, Machine Learning (ML) algorithms can be trained to capture slamming events by analyzing features from measurement signals. The feasibility of using supervised ML techniques is here presented by processing data from a segmented-model of a fast ferry tested in the towing-tank. The extensive test conditions provided a suitable dataset for ML training and comparing the accuracy of results with a physics-based identification model. The slamming identification problem is addressed at two levels: simply counting of slams, and classification of slams into three different groups. A challenging aspect is related to imbalanced data, due to minority of slamming classes, calling for meaningful evaluation metrics. The considered ML models are eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), Supporting Vector Machine and Decision Tree for the detection problem, along with meta-models to deal with classification. A maximum F1-score of 72.4% is reached in slamming detection, while the best weighted F1-score for classification is 84.3%, both obtained with XGBoost. Reducing the number of analyzed features, as in the case of sensor failure, still provides good performance metrics, demonstrating the versatility of the ML approach.\n",

      "The response of a very large floating structure (VLFS) must take into consideration the elastic deformation of the structure (commonly termed hydroelastic response) under wave action. Conventionally, the hydroelastic response could be computed by using the coupled finite element-boundary element (FE-BE) method, where the mat-like structure is modelled using plate theory and the water modelled using the potential theory. The FE-BE method requires the structure to be discretised into finer elements and the wetted surface boundary to be represented by smaller panels to accurately capture the hydroelastic response of the structure. Thus, the coupled FE-BE method could be computationally expensive when the structure gets larger or when subjected to waves of smaller wavelengths. To accelerate the computational time in predicting the hydroelastic response of the VLFS, a surrogate model trained using the feed-forward neural network is proposed. The hydroelastic responses under different wavelengths, structural stiffnesses and wave directions are first generated where these data are split into three groups for training, validation, and testing (prediction) purposes. The accuracy of the prediction in terms of correlation coefficient R is compared for the different train datasets, the number of neurons and hidden layers as well as the optimisation techniques. The finding shows that an accuracy of close to 99% to the ground truth could be achieved with only 80% of the train dataset. The hydroelastic response under irregular wave conditions predicted using the feed-forward neural network framework is also presented.\n",

      "Digital twin has been emerging as a promising paradigm that connects physical entities and digital space, and continuously evolves to optimize the physical systems. In this article, we focus on studying efficient communication and computation scheme when constructing the Marine Internet of Things (M-IoT)’s digital twin with secrecy provisioning. Specifically, the digital twin model is trained based on federated learning, in which all the unmanned surface vehicles deliver the trained models with nonorthogonal multiple access (NOMA) to the high-altitude platform (HAP) for global model aggregation. Considering the potential eavesdropping on the radio signals of HAP, we utilize the chaotic sequences to spread the model information before the global model broadcasting. In this framework, we aim to minimize the total energy consumption for constructing the digital twin of M-IoT by jointly optimizing the global accuracy, the local accuracy, the HAP’s transmission power and NOMA transmission duration, subject to the secrecy provisioning and latency constraint. An effective low-complexity algorithm is proposed to tackle this joint optimization problem with the use of a layered feature. Finally, numerical results are given to validate the performance gain of the proposed scheme, in comparison with the fixed accuracy scheme, the nonspread spectrum scheme and the time division multiple access transmission scheme.\n",

      "The dispatching of automated guided vehicles (AGVs) is essential for efficient horizontal transportation at automated container terminals. Effective planning of AGV transportation can reduce equipment energy consumption and shorten task completion time. Multiple AGVs transport containers between storage blocks and vessels, which can be regarded as the supply sides and demand points of containers. To meet the requirements of shipment in terms of timely and high-efficient delivery, multiple AGVs should be dispatched to deliver containers, which includes assigning tasks and selecting paths. A contract net protocol (CNP) is employed for task assignment in a multiagent system, while machine learning provides a logical alternative, such as Q-learning (QL), for complex path planning. In this study, mathematical models for multi-AGV dispatching are established, and a QL-CNP algorithm is proposed to tackle the multi-AGV dispatching problem (MADP). The distribution of traffic load is balanced for multiple AGVs performing tasks in the road network. The proposed model is validated using a Gurobi solver with a small experiment. Then, QL-CNP is used to conduct experiments with different sizes. The other algorithms, including Dijkstra, GA, and PSO, are also compared with the QL-CNP algorithm. The experimental results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed QL-CNP when addressing the MADP.\n",

      "Recently, with the development of marine space around the world, friction between maritime traffic and various marine activities is intensifying. In particular, different recommendations are being made for the buffer zone between offshore wind farms and maritime traffic, as the criteria vary significantly. In order to respond to these changes in marine space, conducted this study on the change of maritime traffic patterns before and after the installation of floating LiDAR (Light Detection And Ranging) in marine facilities and apply it to future changes in maritime traffic patterns. The maritime traffic data was based on Automatic Identification System (AIS) data, and it was targeted at cargo ships and tankers with regular traffic patterns. A trajectory and spatial analysis were performed based on the AIS in the marine space. As a result of analyzing the globally maritime traffic patterns targeting the location of the installation complex of LiDARs, it can be confirmed that the existing maritime traffic patterns change into three maritime traffic patterns. Furthermore, the study employed the Hausdorff-distance algorithm for clustering analysis, categorizing vessels with similar trajectories. This approach facilitated a locally analysis of the buffer zone associated with individual LiDAR, considering the length of the vessels. As a result, it was analyzed that each vessel navigated at different buffer zone depending on the size of the vessel, and it is possible for safe navigation and forecast the future maritime traffic patterns.\n",

      "Energy efficiency and operational safety practices on ships have gained more importance due to the rules set by the International Maritime Organization in recent years. While approximately 70% of the fuel consumed on a commercial ship is utilized for the propulsion load, a significant portion of the remaining fuel is consumed by the auxiliary generators responsible for the ship’s onboard load. It is crucial to comprehend the impact of the electrical load on the ship’s generators, as it significantly assists maritime operators in strategic energy planning to minimize the chance of unexpected electrical breakdowns during operation. However, an appropriate handling mechanism is required when there are massive datasets and varied input data involved. Thus, this study implements data-driven approaches to estimate the load of a chemical tanker ship’s generator using a 1000-day real dataset. Two case studies were performed, namely, single load prediction for each generator and total load prediction for all generators. The prediction results show that for the single generator load prediction of DG1, DG2, and DG3, the decision tree model encountered the least errors for MAE (0.2364, 0.1306, and 0.1532), RMSE (0.2455, 0.2069, and 0.2182), and MAPE (17.493, 5.1139, and 7.7481).

      "Predictive maintenance (PdM) uses statistical and machine learning methods to detect and predict the onset of faults. PdM is often used in industrial IoT settings in the energy sector, where research works usually consider specific types of faults depending on the application. However, since PdM is mainly data-driven and needs to work in real time, the public availability of datasets is required in order to build efficient and effective models applicable across multiple domains. Unlike methods, the publicly available datasets obtained from sensors in the energy sector have not been properly reviewed or categorized. In this work, we consider five subsectors of the energy sector: wind, solar, oil & gas, diesel & thermal, and electrical power grid. We provide a detailed description of the properties of the publicly available PdM datasets in these subsectors. The review of the datasets is conducted on a number of scientific and commercial repositories: IEEE DataPort, UCI Machine Learning Repository, Kaggle, EDP, and Mendeley Data. The datasets are graded into three categories according to objective criteria. We also provide references to significant related research work that uses the considered datasets. The observed challenges in using the datasets in this field are thoroughly discussed. We find that there is a troublesome scarcity of publicly available datasets in the energy sector, more so of data coming from real, non-simulated sources. Three datasets, 3W (oil & gas), EDP-WT (wind), and OREC (wind) stand out as highly valuable for researchers in this field.\n",

      "The distribution, traceability, and management of shipping container logistics require secure data flow and trusted transactions. Digital Twins (DTs) can realize these features by offering shipping tracking and traceability, process flow and status monitoring, and management of the physical containersall in a remote manner. However, the data of a DT itself is typically stored, controlled, and managed by a centralized entity, which is often the original creator of the physical container. Having a centralized entity can cause mistrust. The centralized entity may alter, tamper, or delete the digital twin data. To overcome this problem, this paper proposes trusted sharing and management of DTs for shipping containers by using Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs). NFTs are digital tokens that hold unique data stored, controlled, and managed in a decentralized and immutable blockchain ledger. We extend in this paper the use of NFTs to tokenize shipping container DTs and their metadata. The proposed solution uses NFTs and Ethereum blockchain smart contracts to offer decentralization, security, transparency, traceability, and immutability to the data and processes involved in the creation, storage, and management of DTs of shipping containers. To demonstrate our solution, we create a DT of a shipping container using Microsoft Azure Digital Twins services and showed how to tokenize it using NFT. We assess the system using various test cases to evaluate its main functionalities. Furthermore, we analyze the cost of transactions and the security of the smart contracts code. We have made the code of our smart contracts publicly available on GitHub.\n",

      "Physics-Based Modelling for On-Line Condition Monitoring of a Marine Engine System\n",
      "The engine system is critical for a marine vehicle, and its performance significantly affects the efficiency and safety of the whole ship. Due to the harsh working environment and the complex system structure, a marine system is prone to have many kinds of novelties and faults. Timely detection of faults via effective condition monitoring is vital for such systems, avoiding serious damage and economic loss. However, it is difficult to realize online monitoring because of the limitations of measurement and health monitoring methods. In this paper, a marine engine system simulator is set up with enhanced sensory placement for static and dynamic data collection. The test rig and processing for static and dynamic data are described. Then, a physics-based multivariate modeling method is proposed for the health monitoring of the system. Case studies are carried out considering the misfire fault and the exhaust valve leakage fault. In the misfire fault test, the exhaust gas temperature of the misfired cylinder dropped from the confidence interval 100–150 °C to 70–80 °C and the head vibration features decreased from the confidence interval 900–1300 m/s2 to around 200–300 m/s2. For the exhaust valve leakage fault, the engine body vibration main bearing impact RMS increased nearly 10 times. Comparisons between the model-predicted confidence interval and measured data reveal that the proposed model based on the fault-related static and dynamic features successfully identified the two faults and their positions, proving the effectiveness of the proposed framework.\n",

If it is now combined with fundamental changes in trade dynamics, volatile market conditions, tighter shipping financing platforms with sustainability-linked interest rates and international safety regulations setup, a completely new framework for commercial ship design characterized by strict and often contradicting requirements emerge In parallel, zero carbon fuels available (readily or in the future) require extensive technological modifications and technical leaps in the current arrangements ship propulsion plants (with little to no existing reference) characterized by elevated consumption figures due to low energy density leading to an overshoot in voyage expense costs and the Total Cost of Ownership (TCO), respectively. Considering such a tight design space, holistic approaches with lifecycle considerations aiming at robust designs are deemed necessary. Pursuant to this roadmap, the authors have developed a design methodology fully integrated within the CAE software CAESES™ that encompass all aspects of ship design (stability, strength, powering and propulsion, safety, economics) and has an inherent dynamic voyage simulation module, enabling the user to simulate the response in variations of the geometrical, design variables of the vessel under uncertainty.

      "Product redesign is widely required in the process of product innovation, which greatly depends on a series of innovative theories of product. Traditional product redesign can identify functional requirements from customer needs by functional analysis and utilize inventive principles of TRIZ to address the problems. However, the relationships between the customer needs (CNs), engineering parameters (EPs), and inventive principles (IPs) has not been explored, which may limit and hinder the opportunity for product innovation. To improve the design efficiency, Random Forest (RF) is introduced in this method to mine the relationship between EPs and IPs by researching many cases for design knowledge. A systematic redesign process is proposed to apply the design knowledge. Firstly, functional analysis is used to decompose customer needs (CNs) into product functions. And then, the effect-based approach which is the application of scientific laws is used to transform functions into EPs. Secondly, IPs are recommended based on EPs by a trained RF model. Finally, the specific solution is generated from the problem domain using the analogy design based on the Su-Field model. The effectiveness of the method is verified in the redesign of solar power systems for unmanned transport ships.\n",

      "Capturing the effect of biofouling on ships by incremental machine learning\n",
      "Performance data from ships is subject to distributional shifts, sometimes referred to as concept drift. In this study, synthetic monitoring data is simulated for the KVLCC2, considering publicly available reference data and a semi-empirical simulation framework. Neural networks are trained to predict the required shaft power and to overcome the deterioration in model accuracy due to concept drift, three methods of incremental learning are applied and compared: (1) Layer freezing, (2) L2 regularization, and (3) elastic weight consolidation. Furthermore, an implicit methodology for quantifying the changing hull and propeller performance is presented. In addition, a generic feature engineering framework is used for eliminating insignificant features. In two investigations, sudden and incremental concept drift scenarios are examined, and the effect of different uncertainty categories on model performance is studied in parallel based on three different datasets. As a main finding, it is confirmed that data quality is of great importance for accurate machine learning-driven performance monitoring — even in simulated environments. Furthermore, the study shows that freezing layers during incremental learning proves to be most robust and accurate, but it will be part of future work to examine this on actual sensor data.\n",

      "An Effective Multi-Layer Attention Network for SAR Ship Detection\n",
      "The use of deep learning-based techniques has improved the performance of synthetic aperture radar (SAR) image-based applications, such as ship detection. However, all existing methods have limited object detection performance under the conditions of varying ship sizes and complex background noise, to the best of our knowledge. In this paper, to solve both the multi-scale problem and the noisy background issues, we propose a multi-layer attention approach based on the thorough analysis of both location and semantic information. The solution works by exploring the richness of spatial information of the low-level feature maps generated by a backbone and the richness of semantic information of the high-level feature maps created by the same method. Additionally, we integrate an attention mechanism into the network to exclusively extract useful features from the input maps. Tests involving multiple SAR datasets show that our proposed solution enables significant improvements to the accuracy of ship detection regardless of vessel size and background complexity. Particularly for the widely-adopted High-Resolution SAR Images Dataset (HRSID), the new method provides a 1.3% improvement in the average precision for detection. The proposed new method can be potentially used in other feature-extraction-based classification, detection, and segmentation.\n",

      "The frequency-domain methods used to predict fatigue damage in offshore structure are widely employed in practice due to their simple algorithms and fast computation speed. While reliable accuracy can be achieved with current prediction methods for narrowband stress processes, actual offshore fields often exhibit wideband stress responses, resulting in more complex relations between the rainflow stress distribution, power spectral density, and fatigue damage. This study proposes a novel fatigue prediction method for wideband stress processes that utilizes Monte Carlo simulation for designed standard spectra. An empirical formula is derived to calculate the expected damage rate, considering material properties, spectral moments, and rainflow range distribution moments. To verify the accuracy of the model, 3-month onsite measured stress data from a semi-submersible platform are used, and the proposed method is compared with several typical prediction methods with explicit expressions. The results indicate that the expected damage rate is determined by the spectral moments of power spectral density, assuming fixed material properties. The proposed method shows good prediction accuracy for the field data and has a significant improvement of fatigue damage prediction for various bandwidth processes.\n",

      "Experimental Investigation to Assess the Performance Characteristics of a Marine Two-Stroke Dual Fuel Engine under Diesel and Natural Gas Mode\n",
      "With the aim of CO2 emissions reduction in the maritime sector, dual fuel engines operating on natural gas are the most prominent technical and commercially available solution. A promising variant is the two-stroke high-pressure natural gas injection engine, utilizing diesel pilot fuel injection for ignition of the gaseous fuel while being able to operate in diesel-only mode. In this study, a comparative analysis of the performance and the combustion mechanism of dual fuel and diesel mode for this engine type is conducted using experimental data. Studies based on measurements conducted on actual scale are limited in the literature due to the engines’ sheer size not allowing lab testing. The analysis was conducted using measurements acquired during the factory acceptance tests involving conventional operating data and cylinder pressure data acquired using a piezoelectric sensor. In terms of the mean pressure and temperature, only minor differences were found. The specific fuel consumption was improved under low load operation for the dual fuel mode by 1.8%, while a small increase of 1.2% was found near full load. Differences were found in the combustion process from 25 to 75% load with considerably faster premixed and diffusion combustion for the dual fuel mode leading to a 6–8% decrease in combustion duration. Despite the combustion process differences, the performance under dual fuel operation was overall close to that of conventional diesel with an acceptable 1.5% efficiency reduction on average. This confirms that modern dual fuel marine engines can achieve the performance standards of conventional ones while benefiting from low-carbon fuel use to reduce CO2 emissions.\n",

The shaft undergoes modal and static analysis. The reactive forces in the bearings and the stress and strain in the shaft are determined. The form and frequency of the structure’s intrinsic vibrations are derived. On that basis, the state of the shaft may be assessed, with or without load.

      "Despite the pursued autonomous ships initiatives, the lack of information on emerging technologies and their costs along with the limited investigations of the autonomy effects on logistics render these vessels feasibility assessment challenging. This study aims at developing an overarching framework to support decisions for the transition to autonomous shipping. The ship lifetime capital, operational and voyage expenditures are estimated to quantify the economic-environmental impact and required investments. Several scenarios are defined to address the input data uncertainty. The case of a short-sea shipping cargo vessel operating in the Norwegian waters is studied, considering its conversion to operate autonomously, as well as the next generation crewless ship design. The derived results demonstrate that the converted autonomous ships can reduce the lifetime present value by 1–12% and the carbon emissions by 4%, whereas the next-generation autonomous ships design leads to their further reductions by 3–4% and 4–7%, respectively. These savings can further increase by 6–7% by reducing the autonomous ships sailing speed, as crew replacement periods are not required. The estimated economic margin indicates that the next-generation autonomous ships can adopt greener technologies, such as hydrogen or green ammonia, to achieve the targeted carbon emissions reduction.\n",

      "Human cyber-physical systems present an appealing platform for facilitating human-centered computing, particularly in environments where humans are required to interact with systems comprised of cyber and physical layers. Universally accepted elements of a human cyber-physical system, and interactions among these elements, do not appear to emerge in literature. To address this, a human cyber-physical system architecture is offered, led by the seafaring focus of this study. A human cyber-physical system implementation, called Mariner 4.0, for monitoring motion sickness of seafarers is presented to demonstrate the operation of a human cyber-physical system as a platform for human-centered computing. The human cyber-physical system implementation enabled the digital representation of the state of motion sickness and location of a seafarer, and conveyance of related information through a state monitor display. Using data captured on board South Africa’s polar supply and research vessel, the SA Agulhas II, results showed that the human cyber-physical system incorporated location-specific variation in motion exposure experienced between two seafarers in motion sickness computations through facilitating individualized data acquisition and integration.\n",

      "Most large commercial vessels are propelled by low-speed two-stroke diesel engines due to their fuel economy and reliability. With increasing international concern about emissions and the rise in oil prices, improvements in engine efficiency are urgently needed. In the present work, a zero-dimensional model for a low-speed two-stroke diesel engine is developed that considers the exhaust gas bypass and geometry structures for the gas exchange model. The model was applied to a low-speed two-stroke 7G80 ME-C9 marine diesel engine and validated with engine shop test data, which consisted of the main engine performance parameters and cylinder pressure diagrams at different loads. The simulation results were in good agreement with the experimental data. Thus, the model has the ability to predict engine performance with good accuracy. After model validation, the variations in compression ratio, fuel injection timing, exhaust gas bypass valve opening portion, exhaust valve opening timing, and exhaust valve closing timing effects on engine performance were tested. Finally, the influence level of different parameters on engine performance was summarized, which can be used as a reference to determine the reasons for high fuel consumption in some cases. The developed engine performance model is considerable in digital twins for performance simulation, health management, and optimization.\n",

      "The importance of comfort during transfer and stationing becomes a key performance parameter for large yacht design, on the same level as propulsive issues. Such a matter extends questions in terms of form and service demand to the motion behaviour of the unit in waves. Relevant studies refer to outdated hull forms not specific to modern large yachts. In this study, five hull forms with different bow concepts represent the most common design solutions for yachts at constant draught and displacement. The preliminary ranking on the effect of alternative bows on comfort requires the definition of internationally accepted comfort standards. Here, the AWI 22834 guidelines for large yachts provide the service and environmental conditions and criteria for the comfort analysis, being the only reference specific to yachts. The calculations employ a strip-theory-based numerical model to provide results of easy understanding for designers during the early design stage. The obtained ranking among the design solutions on a reference large yacht favours the option nested with a bulb, contradicting the expectations in favour of a vertical bow concept. The discussion and conclusions provide a way forward for additional analyses and investigations aimed at proposing suitable multicriterial design guidelines for large yachts. However, the results also show the unsuitability of AWI environmental and encounter conditions for hull form ranking.\n",

      "A Co-simulation-Based System Using Vico for Marine Operation\n",
      "Marine operations are becoming more and more demanding. Efficient modeling and analysis of marine operations under environmental effects, especially in high sea states, will provide a means to improve operational safety. Traditional modeling and analysis are often carried out based on establishing the combined equations of the multi-body system. However, modeling, simulation and analysis of sub-systems may be performed in different software tools or require extensive derivation. It is inconvenient to vary the system configuration regardless of manufacturing design or behavior analysis perspectives. Co-simulation as an emerging technology enables the reusing and sharing of models so that different sub-systems can be modeled independently but simulated together. In this study, a system based on a co-simulation platform - Vico is proposed, which enables the digitalization of marine operations from modeling, configuration to simulation. The system consists of multiple sub-models of the ship, the marine crane and their coupling component, which are all converted and exported as functional mock-up units (FMUs). Various scenario settings such as environmental effect, ship maneuver and crane payload can be configured for the simulation of specific marine operations. Taking the research vessel Gunnerus as the testbed, two case studies about the impacts from the environment and a shipboard crane on marine operations are conducted. The simulation results verify the effectiveness of the marine operation system. The system could also be a foundation for further research on onboard support of marine operations.\n",

      "Integrated machine learning and probabilistic degradation approach for vessel electric motor prognostics\n",
      "In the transition towards more sustainable ships, electric motors (EM) are being used in ship propulsion systems to reduce emissions and increase efficiency. The safe operation of ships is crucial, and prognostics and health management applications have emerged as effective solutions to transit towards monitored reliable systems. In this context, this paper presents a probabilistic EM prognostics model integrating data-driven operational models and physics-informed degradation models. Firstly, motor torque and winding temperature are estimated through connected machine learning models, which are based on operational and meteorological data. Operational and meteorological variables drive the EM degradation model and enable the analysis of EM degradation under different operational and environmental conditions. Subsequently, EM remaining useful life (RUL) is predicted within a probabilistic Monte-Carlo approach combining the thermal-stress model along with the associated uncertainties. The methodology is tested on a real case study of the OV Ryvingen vessel, with collected data during voyages along the Norwegian coast. Results confirm the validity of the designed RUL model showing that, under normal operation conditions, the degradation is mild, and the temperature measurement errors are important for RUL estimation.\n",

      "Visual aids for navigation systems are a key function of intelligent onboard navigation units for ships. These systems visualize the planning decisions of an intelligent navigation unit for computer-aided visual navigation to reduce the cognitive workload of the driving control personnel of an intelligent ship. In this study, we propose a dynamic data driven method to simulate the motion of ships on the water. We constructed a validation dataset for ship motion simulation toward visual-aided navigation considering the combined effects of wind, waves and currents. According to the validation results on this dataset, the proposed simulation method exhibited good accuracy and real-time performance. Under the given control and environmental input series, the mean errors of simulated heading and simulated trajectory were 5.7°/h and 282.6 m/h, respectively; the simulation time was 475 ms for each hour of physical duration. Overall, the proposed simulation method satisfies the need for visual navigation aids and could improve the situational awareness of the driving control personnel of the intelligent ship.\n",

      "Reliable and continuous operation of the equipment is expected in the wastewater treatment plant, as any perturbations can lead to environmental pollution and the need to pay penalties. Optimization and minimization of operating costs of the pump station cannot, therefore, lead to a reduction in reliability but rather should be based on preventive works, the necessity of which should be foreseen. The purpose of this paper is to develop an accurate model to predict a pump’s mean time to failure, allowing for rational planning of maintenance. The pumps operate under the supervision of the automatic control system and SCADA, which is the source of historical data on pump operation parameters. This enables the research and development of various methods and algorithms for optimizing service activities. In this case, a multiple linear regression model is developed to describe the impact of historical data on pump operation for pump maintenance. In the literature, the least squares method is used to estimate unknown regression coefficients for this data. The original value of the paper is the application of the genetic algorithm to estimate coefficient values of the multiple linear regression model of failure-free time of the pump. Necessary analysis and simulations are performed on the data collected for submersible pumps in a sewage pumping station. As a result, an improvement in the adequacy of the presented model was identified.\n",

      "A practical estimation methodology of the mean added resistance in irregular waves is shown, and the present paper provides statistical analyses of estimates for ships in actual conditions. The study merges telemetry data of more than 200 in-service container vessels with ocean re-analysis data from ERA5. Theoretical estimates relying on spectral calculations of added resistance are made for both long- and short-crested waves and are based on a combination of a parametric expression for the wave spectrum and a semi-empirical formula for the added resistance transfer function. The theoretical estimates are compared to predictions from an indirect calculation of added resistance relying on shaft power measurements and empirical estimates of the remaining resistance components. Overall, the comparison reveals a bias in bow oblique waves and higher sea states of the spectral estimates as well as a large variance of the empirically derived predictions — particularly in beam-to-following waves. One of the study’s main findings, confirming previous studies but based on a much larger dataset than in earlier similar studies, is that added resistance assessment based on in-service data is complex due to significant associated uncertainties.\n",

      "The Control-Oriented Heat Release Rate Model for a Marine Dual-Fuel Engine under All the Operating Modes and Loads\n",
      "An accurate model plays an important role in control strategy development of smart ships. For the control-oriented engine models, calibration by experienced personnel is key to outputting high accuracy. However, the dual-fuel engine runs in liquid fuel mode, gas fuel mode, and fuel sharing mode. It is impossible to tune a single model or a set of parameters for the dual-fuel engine under all operating modes and loads. On the basis of our experience and practice, a Wiebe-based heat release rate model is used. To make the Wiebe model available for the dual-fuel engine, the Wiebe parameters are assumed to be linear functions. The combustion beginning angle is modeled as a function of fuel quantity in liquid fuel mode and as a look-up table in gas fuel mode for all loads. The combustion duration and the combustion distribution factor are modeled as a function of fuel quantity and engine revolution both in liquid fuel mode and in gas fuel mode. In fuel sharing mode, the heat release rate is modeled as a combination of the heat release rate models in liquid fuel mode and gas fuel mode. This model is called the SL model. For a further discussion, four types of combinations in fuel sharing mode are investigated. In addition, in liquid fuel mode and gas fuel mode, the combustion duration model and the combustion distribution factor model are replaced by the Woschni/Anisits model, which was specifically used in the diesel engine. This variation of model is called the WA model. To validate our hypothesis and models, the Wiebe parameters in liquid fuel mode and gas fuel mode are given, four types of combinations and two cases of comparisons in fuel sharing model are discussed, and the engine performance is checked and analysed. Results show that for the SL model, the average RMSE is 1.45% in the liquid fuel mode, 2.22% in the gas fuel mode, and 2.53% in the fuel sharing mode. For the WA model, the RMSE of the NOx is 9.79% in liquid fuel mode and 45.20% in gas fuel mode. Its maximum error reaches −65.54%. The proposed SL model is accurate and can generate Wiebe parameters that are better than the carefully tuned parameters. The WA model is not suitable for engine models that require NOx-emission-related parameters.\n",

The way we work with Computer Aided Design (CAD) tools is also changing thanks to the ubiquitous access to information and the different hardware available to exploit that information: Augmented Reality, Virtual Reality or Mixed Reality. Not only the way we work, but also the way we interact with CAD tools is changing, with technologies like natural language processes that allows direct conversation with the applications. The concepts that are absolutely clear from now to the future in shipbuilding are the use of Data Centric models and the concept of Digital Twin. Both provide a real and effective synchronization between what we design and what we construct, by covering the complete life cycle of the product, thanks to technologies like the Internet of Things (IoT) and Radio Frequency IDentification (RFID). Nowadays it is unimaginable to work without using CAD in shipbuilding: ease of design with design rules embedded, speed of design, and the use and reuse of information. It is expected that in the future CAD tools will advance further and allow greater information management through further improvements. The paper presents several scenarios with improvements likely to occur the next few years. Some of these improvements may seem unrealistic in the short term, but reality often exceeds expectations in any field, and probably more so with technology.\n",

      "Because container terminals are facing pressure to achieve carbon neutrality in China, saving energy has become an important objective of container terminals. This paper analyzed the movement path of containers between the quay carne and the yard, and found that paths in the vertical direction existed, requiring unnecessary energy consumption. To solve the unnecessary energy consumption problem, a completely new work mode called the high platform operation mode was proposed. In this new mode, a high platform is built above the yard and container trucks drive onto the high platform. By building an energy consumption model to compare the energy consumption of the traditional and new modes, we found that the new mode is able to save 1.478 kWh of electricity compared to the traditional mode when handling one container. A terminal company in Tianjin Port was taken as an example to examine and validate the efficiency of the proposed mode. The computational results indicate that the electricity saved in 12 years would be able to cover the cost of building the high platform, meaning that the new mode could reduce container terminals’ energy consumption and accelerate the achievement of carbon neutrality.\n",

State-of-the-art obstacle detection algorithms are based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs). While CNNs provide higher detection accuracy and fast detection speed, they require enormous amounts of data for their training. In particular, the availability of domain-specific datasets is a challenge for obstacle detection. The difficulty in conducting onsite experiments limits the collection of maritime datasets. Owing to the logistic cost of conducting on-site operations, simulation tools provide a safe and cost-efficient alternative for data collection. In this work, we introduce SimuShips, a publicly available simulation-based dataset for maritime environments. Our dataset consists of 9471 high-resolution (1920x1080) images which include a wide range of obstacle types, atmospheric and illumination conditions along with occlusion, scale and visible proportion variations. We provide annotations in the form of bounding boxes. In addition, we conduct experiments with YOLOv5 to test the viability of simulation data.

      "With recent advances in underwater inspections of ships with remote sensing technologies the need for automated data annotations and analysis becomes apparent. During underwater ship inspections, various data such as video, positioning information, and other telemetry data are collected and combined with the results of computer vision models. The variability in the modalities of data makes the automatic analysis across multiple data sources challenging. We propose the use of a Knowledge Graph in combination with industry standards in the ship inspection domain for the taxonomy. This enables automated data analysis for underwater ship inspection videos which is the requirement for different downstream use cases. In this work, we demonstrate the applicability of our approach on 12 ship inspections in two downstream tasks. First, we aim at supporting a detailed ship status report generation, and second, we demonstrate big data analytics for several inspections. We use the fused data to compare different ships by identifying patterns in the findings aided by computer vision algorithms.\n",

This is realized using virtual sensors that can estimate the sensor fault in order to reconstruct the faulty measurements. Due to the Differential-Algebraic mathematical description of marine fuel engine dynamics, we design three types of virtual sensors; using adaptive observers, Set Inversion via Interval Analysis (SIVIA) and static models.

      "An onboard monitoring system can measure features such as stress cycles counts and provide warnings due to slamming. Considering current technology trends there is the opportunity of incorporating machine learning methods into monitoring systems. A hull monitoring system has been developed and installed on a 111 m wave piercing catamaran (Hull 091) to remotely monitor the ship kinematics and hull structural responses. Parallel to that, an existing dataset of a similar vessel (Hull 061) was analysed using unsupervised and supervised learning models; these were found to be beneficial for the classification of bow entry events according to key kinematic parameters. A comparison of different algorithms including linear support vector machines, naïve Bayes and decision tree for the bow entry classification were conducted. In addition, using empirical probability distributions, the likelihood of wet-deck slamming was estimated given a vertical bow acceleration threshold of 1  in head seas, clustering the feature space with the approximate probabilities of 0.001, 0.030 and 0.25.\n",

      "The International Data Spaces Association (IDSA) has promoted the idea of International Data Spaces as a place for companies to share data with trust and security enforced by software and organizational competence. There has been considerable progress in delivering corporate guidelines, technical specifications, and software components available for testing and deploying applications to support IDS-based ecosystems, such as the IDS data connectors classified by the Fraunhofer Institute. However, full implementation of IDS applications seems still complex and expensive for small and medium enterprises (SMEs). A possible strategy to deal with such an issue is to break the IDSA specification’s complexity into smaller pieces and build small IDS ecosystems formed by its core business roles (e.g., data owners, users, and broker service providers). In this context, this paper addresses the problem of designing an application to support the broker service provider’s role in operating in an IDS-based ecosystem. This research, therefore, follows a Design Science approach in a three-step process. First, it investigates problems of practical relevance elicited from the IDSA guidelines in combination with requirements provided by representatives of the Dutch Logistics sector. Second, it gives design to tackle the problem by combining Semantic Web, Linked Data, and Enterprise Architecture modeling artifacts. Last, it validates the architecture of the broker service provider’s application by demonstrating its technical feasibility, innovation, and software integration.\n",

      "Structural integrity management is gaining popularity because of the wide-spreading application of the digital twin concept, which is based on the fusion of the real-world measurement data and digital model used for the design. Data fusion between the measurement data and design model makes structural integrity management a feasible solution with a limited number of sensors, provided a reliable and robust local response estimation algorithm can be provided. This paper presents a methodology through which a local stress response at an arbitrary location within a seagoing vessel can be estimated using onboard measurement data. For the response transfer from the measured location A to the unmeasured location B, the relative RAO, which defines the ratio of response amplitude between location A to B, was introduced. The relative RAO concept was applied by decomposing the response spectrum at measured location A into its comprising directional components using the least square method with non-parametric modeling. The proposed method was validated using the numerically generated pseudo measurement data, where some noises were introduced artificially to imitate the actual measurement. Finally, the full-scale measurement data of the 13,000TEU container carrier was analyzed and used to verify the proposed method.\n",

      "The digital twin technology platform has not yet achieved the expected acceptance and wider implementation in the maritime industry. So far, most of the focus of the digital twin application discussions have centred around what to learn from big data in ship operation, and to a lesser extent, has anybody extended this discussion to include the benefits such new technology can contribute to the enhancement of the upstream ship concept and basic design activities, as well as detailed engineering. This paper particularly pays attention to this latter, partly forgotten, application area. There could be many reasons behind such a reluctance to take on new technology and utilize it to its full potential. It is hypothesized and argued by this article that the development has focused on applications that are too complex, too expensive and reflect, to a little extent, real-life needs. Lack of effective data transfer and transaction interphases among relevant stakeholders is another important factor creating these inefficiencies.  This paper document how and why such inefficiencies in novel digitization technology adoption and adaptation exist and hamper the progress of achieving noticeable benefits of such implementations and how such development hurdles can be eliminated.\n",

      "In the initial sizing of complex vessels, where recourse to type ship design can be overly restrictive, one crucial set of design features has traditionally been poorly addressed. This is the estimation of the weight and space demands of the various Distributed Ship Services Systems (DS3), which include different types of commodity services beyond those primarily associated with the ship propulsion system. In general, naval vessels are typified by extensive and densely engineered DS3, with the modern naval submarine being at the extreme of dense outfitting. Despite this, the ability for the concept designer to consider the impact of different configurations for the DS3 arrangements has not been readily addressed in concept design. This paper describes ongoing work at University College London (UCL) to develop a novel DS3 synthesis approach utilising computer tools, such as Paramarine™, MATLAB®, and CPLEX®, which provide the concept designer with a quantitative network-based evaluation to enable DS3 space and weight inputs early in the design process. The results of applying the approach to a conventional submarine case study indicate quantitative insights into early DS3 sizing can be obtained. The paper concludes with likely developments in concluding the research study.\n",

      "Designers perform early-stage formative usability tests with low-fidelity prototypes to improve the design of new products. This low-tech prototype style reduces the manufacturing resources but limits the functions that can be assessed. Recent advances in technology enable designers to create low-fidelity 3D models for users to engage in a virtual environment. Three-dimensional models communicate design concepts and are not often used in formative usability testing. The proposed method discusses how to create a virtual replica of a product by assessing key human interaction steps and addresses the limitations of translating those steps into a virtual environment. In addition, the paper will provide a framework to evaluate the usability of a product in a virtual setting, with a specific emphasis on low-resource online testing in the user population. A study was performed to pilot the subject’s experience with the proposed approach and determine how the virtual online simulation impacted the performance. The study outcomes demonstrated that subjects were able to successfully interact with the virtual replica and found the simulation realistic. This method can be followed to perform formative usability tests earlier and incorporate subject feedback into future iterations of their design, which can improve safety and product efficacy.\n",

      "The noise in the marine engine room has always been a major cause of disturbance and damage to sailors’ physical and mental health; however, the antinoise countermeasures were being ignored by the industry. To further reduce the noise in the marine engine room, the system structure of active noise control (ANC) and the theoretical basis of the least mean square (LMS) and filtered X least mean square (FXLMS) algorithm are studied. Based on the FXLMS algorithm ANC system, the simulation study of active noise control in the marine engine room of a multigas carrier is carried out. According to the simulation results by the diagrams plotted on the time domain and spectrum, the ANC systems with the FXLMS algorithm can effectively reduce the noise in the marine engine room by about 20 dB, especially for the peak low-frequency range of 20–500 Hz with a large antinoise effect.\n",

      "Industrial Control Systems are used nowadays in many safety-critical applications, such as Naval Defense systems. These latter need high-level protection against cyberattacks, which can lead to potential disastrous consequences (e.g., components sabotage, Denial of Service, human deaths). Thus, these infrastructures, before being deployed in mission, need intensive security testing and validation. Moreover, cybersecurity research is required to anticipate future attacks. The research of new countermeasures has to be led on realistic platforms for getting precise and fruitful feedback for cyberdefense. This paper describes an Industrial Control System testbed for Naval Defense cybersecurity research. This realistic testbed implements a representative model of a warship, on which practical attacks and related countermeasures can be safely benchmarked. After describing the features of our physical testbed, we illustrate its relevance by describing four different attack scenarios. This testbed will be very useful in future works to elaborate and validate innovative cyberdefense measures (like knowledge-based and behavior-based intrusion detection) against network and physical process attacks, especially by generating representative datasets.\n",

      "Although industry 4.0 has gained increased attention in the industry, academic, and governmental fields, there is a lack of information about the relationship between this digital transformation and sustainable development. This work explores the concept of sustainability applied in industry 4.0 and the main advantages that this revolution incorporates into society. To this end, a conscientiously documented investigation was conducted by reviewing actual case studies or scenarios where sustainability was applied in different manufacturing industries, enterprises, or research fields worldwide. A critical and descriptive analysis of the information was performed to identify the main tools and procedures that can be implemented in the industry to address the triple bottom line perspective of industry 4.0, and the results are presented in this document. From the analysis, it was observed that currently, I4.0 has been mainly adopted to improve efficiency and cost reduction in manufacturing companies. However, since only a few enterprises embrace the social paradigm of I4.0, a significant gap in understanding and unbalance is visualized. Therefore, we conclude that there is a lack of information on social benefits and the barriers that must be overcome from the social perspective. On the other hand, this work highlights the importance of adopting industry 4.0 as a positive way to improve the performance of emerging technologies, such as fuel cells, solar cells, and wind turbines, while producing products or services with high efficiency and profitability incomes. For practitioners, this work can provide insightful information about the real implications of I4.0 from a sustainability perspective in our daily life and the possible strategies to improve sustainable development.\n",

      "Technologies are evolving faster than our capability to develop applications that bring us the value we can get from them. The potential is clear and the opportunity will be for those who identify the right application for each technology. One of the foundations of the fourth industrial revolution is the ability to handle huge amounts of data that is everywhere and available to anyone, thanks to the evolution in communication technologies. However, data is not information; it is necessary to have the capability to analyse, then extract conclusions and to learn from both. Technologies, such as Big Data (BD), Machine Learning (ML) and Artificial Intelligence (AI), give the capability to do this, but what really matters is how it is applied. Those who are able to recognise the value of analysing data correctly, to transform it into information and apply it to the improvement of the design, manufacturing, operation and maintenance processes will be successful in the industrial transformation that is taking place. This skill requires practitioners to make the best decisions and ultimately optimise the life cycle of the industrial products. Some of the fields of application of these technologies are already evident. It is possible to imagine how these technologies can enable ship design by applying rules, which will facilitate the design significantly. Equally, by integrating the validation of the structural models by the Classification Societies and much of the design through cloud based applications. The adoption proposed in this article is based on the evolution of CAD applications towards a central data model and with the aim of achieving a true Digital Twin. With a real and effective synchronization between what is designed, manufactured and what is operated, making it possible to cover the complete life cycle of the product. In this process, it is also very important to consider peoples experiences. It is necessary to understand how the new generations are immersed in a technological world, which is in a constant and rapid evolution. This interaction with this ecosystem will determine how the new rules should be defined for the CAD/CAM/CIM Systems. This paper examines some practical use cases in the design phase of shipbuilding as an example of what new technologies could provide ship design and shipbuilding in the near future.\n",

      "The analysis and understanding of the complex behaviour of a ship propulsion plant are of great importance for novel system design, control system synthesis/optimization and to sustain the safety of ship operation in harsh sea conditions. The convenient way to evaluate the design and propulsion performance of a ship in waves is by simulation combining the experimentally obtained characteristics of hull and propeller with the dynamic model of the prime mover. However, the propeller and engine compose a strongly coupled system, in which fluctuating inflow velocity into the propeller due to the wave and hull motions causes propeller torque and rotating speed fluctuations. The latter affects the response of the propulsion engine and vice versa; however, considering the propulsion system response in waves by a full-scale test is hardly possible. Thus, in the past, the authors have developed the experimental methodology of the self-propelled ship model test in which an intelligent propeller drive is controlled by a Marine Diesel Engine Simulator (MDES) providing the response of the engine model in real time, based on the measured propeller torque and speed. This paper introduces further development of MDES in which a full-state dynamic cycle-mean value engine model was introduced providing deep insight into propulsion engine responses in a real-like condition of the actual sea. The similarity of the engine responses at the ship model scale is ensured by the original method of equations transformation developed by the authors. The newly developed MDES was introduced into the self-propulsion model, and a test series in regular waves was performed. The obtained responses were compared with the results of numerical simulation of the full-scale model confirming the validity of the new development and the importance of intrinsic engine characteristics on propulsion system response in waves.\n",

      "In order to track the desired path under unknown parameters and environmental disturbances, an adaptive backstepping sliding mode control algorithm with a neural estimator is proposed for underactuated ships considering both ship-bank interaction effect and shift angle. Using the features of radial basis function neural network, which can approximate arbitrary function, the unknown parameters of the ship model and environmental disturbances are estimated. The trajectory tracking errors include stabilizing sway and surge velocities errors. Based on the Lyapunov stability theory, the tracking error will converge to zero and the system is asymptotically stable. The controlled trajectory is contractive and asymptotically tends to the desired position and attitude. The results show that compared with the basic sliding mode control algorithm, the overshoot of the adaptive backstepping sliding mode control with neural estimator is smaller and the regulation time of the system is shorter. The ship can adjust itself and quickly reach its desired position under disturbances. This shows that the designed RBF neural network observer can track both the mild level 3 sea state and the bad level 5 sea state, although the wave disturbance has relatively fast time-varying disturbance. The algorithm has good tracking performance and can realize the accurate estimation of wave disturbance, especially in bad sea conditions.\n",

      "The estimation of the propulsion system states and especially of the main engine is essential for control, diagnosis and performance evaluation. If all the required sensors were available, providing required measurements, the state and performance monitoring is of no particular difficulty. However, not all the required parameters can be measured directly, or the addition of multiple measurement channels is out of appropriateness. Furthermore, the propulsion plant state dynamics is justified by propeller load torque fluctuation that in turn is caused by fluctuating effective inflow velocity into the propeller, and which cannot be measured directly. Thus, the problem of estimating unmeasured state and disturbance variables of the propulsion system is considered and formulated as the design of an unknown input observer under model uncertainty and nonlinearity. To solve the design problem, this paper introduces a nonlinear engine dynamic model to catch the internal engine states and an unscented Kalman filter for concurrently performing disturbance and state estimation. The effectiveness is verified through the experiments.\n",

      "As global warming intensifies, the development of offshore wind farms is swiftly progressing, especially deep-water Floating Offshore Wind Turbines (FOWTs) capable of energy capture in deep-sea regions, which have emerged as a focal point of both academic and industrial interest. Although numerous researchers have conducted comprehensive and multifaceted studies on various components of wind turbines, less attention has been paid to the operational stage responses of FOWTs to wind, waves, and currents and the reliability of their structural components. This study primarily employs a theoretical analysis to establish mathematical models under a series of reasonable assumptions, examining the possibility of collisions between FOWT transport fleets and other vessels in the passage area during the towing process. Using the model, this paper takes the Wanning Floating Offshore Wind Farm (FOWF) project, which is scheduled to be deployed in the South China Sea, as its research object and calculates the probability of collisions between FOWTs and other vessels in three months from the pier near Wanning, Hainan, to a predetermined position 22 km away. The findings of the analysis indicate that the mathematical model developed in this study integrates the quantities and velocities of navigational vessels within the target maritime area as well as the speeds, routes, and schedules of the FOWT transport fleet. By employing statistical techniques and geometric calculations, the model can determine the frequency of collisions between various types of vessels and the FOWT transport fleet during the transportation period. This has substantial relevance for future risk assessments and disaster prevention and mitigation measures in the context of FOWT transportation.\n",

      "Due to the growing rate of energy consumption, it is necessary to develop frameworks for enhancing ship energy efficiency. This paper proposes a solution for this issue by introducing a digital twin framework for quantifying ship performance. For this purpose, extensive low-level clustering is performed using Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM) with the Expectation Maximization algorithm on a dataset of a selected vessel to detect the vessel's most frequent operating regions. Then, a regression analysis is performed in each operating region, to identify their shapes using Singular Value Decomposition (SVD). The results of SVD make the basis for model development in digital twin applications. For this reason, a low-level clustering is performed so that a more accurate model can be developed in future. Moreover, based on the resulting cluster analysis, an energy efficiency index is developed, and the energy efficiency of each cluster has been evaluated to identify the most efficient operating condition. Hence, the main contribution of this research is to develop a digital twin framework of a marine engine which can be utilized for green ship operations. The same contribution can facilitate the shipping industry to meet the International Maritime Organization energy efficiency requirements.\n",

It utilizes a temperature and stress calculation program as a platform to create twin models for real-time assessment of the temperature and stress within the storage tank. By comparing with the Fluent simulation of physical field leakage, the DT model realizes real-time inversion of the temperature field and stress field from sensor data to the whole region. To enhance the diagnostic and predictive capabilities of the DT system, we flatten the computed temperature nephogram from the DT model and employ machine vision techniques to extract cloud map features. Machine learning methods such as support vector machine (SVM) and linear regression are utilized to achieve leakage diagnosis, leakage volume calculation, and leakage location calculation. Additionally, we introduce the sequence-to-sequence (Seq2seq) framework and combine it with convolutional neural networks (CNN) and long short-term memory (LSTM) to train the time series of nephogram, enabling spatiotemporal prediction of leakage areas.\n",

      "Under increasingly severe emission restrictions in the shipbuilding industry, integrated power systems are coming to the fore as an increasingly popular alternative solution. However, improving irregular power profiles of the shipboard microgrid can be highly challenging due to the distributed power resources and multi-scenario loads involved. To guarantee the “green, safe and sustainable future” of the shipping industry, large-scale energy storage systems (ESSs) integration has been identified as an effective solution for improving the operating flexibility and reliability of the shipboard microgrid and reducing environmental impacts. However, this paper found that uncertain marine environmental disturbances will protrude state coupling characteristics of ESSs, bringing more uncertain operating states than land-based applications. Therefore, the corresponding uncertain navigation conditions tightly couple the conventional loads allocating with ESS management and make the shipboard microgrids a complex power-transport and information-transport nexus. In this paper, voltage issues of the shipboard microgrid are comprehensively summarized, and a power control model of the shipboard microgrid is mathematically modeled to formulate irregular power profiles. Then, the impact of uncertain marine environmental disturbances on ESSs is discussed for the first time, thereby proposing a preliminary state coupling model of ESS based on our battery test experiment of six months. Finally, the formulated model is analytically reviewed according to different power control approaches, and a novel adaptive power allocation scheme is proposed to account for two major issue of resources and loads coupling characteristics and ESS states coupling characteristics, which can superior deal with non-periodic and irregular power flows and shipboard ESS dynamics. Future research directions are discussed regarding high-precision power control models of ESSs and integrated shipboard cyber–physical controller systems.\n",

      "Design and implementation of marine information management network security system based on artificial intelligence embedded technology\n",
      "The complexity of marine information types, data diversity, data collection difficulties and other aspects makes the network security of marine information management more and more prominent, and has become a major issue affecting the stability of the country and society, so it is urgent to establish a marine information management network security system. Traditional network security technology adopts a passive approach and cannot actively detect viruses, trojans, and other hidden objects in the network. Antivirus software would only be used when attacked. If the risk of network attack is too great, the consequences would be unimaginable. This paper designed a marine information management network security system based on artificial intelligence embedded technology, which improved the efficiency of marine information security management. This paper also applied the embedded technology of AI to the network security management, and proposed the k-means clustering algorithm (K-Means) of AI, which can greatly improve the network security. The experimental results in this paper showed that the intrusion detection rates of System 1 and System 2 were 56.3% and 78.3% respectively when the number of viruses was 50 at 30M, and 65.5% and 80.1% respectively when the number of viruses was 50 at 60M. It showed that the intrusion detection rate of System 2 was higher both at 30M and 60M.\n",

      "The present study addresses two critical controversies surrounding the emerging Industry 5.0 agenda. Firstly, it seeks to elucidate the driving forces behind the accelerated momentum of the Industry 5.0 agenda amidst the ongoing digital industrial transformation. Secondly, it explores how the agenda’s sustainability values can be effectively realised. The study conducted a comprehensive content-centric literature synthesis and identified how Industry 4.0 shortcomings adversely impacted sustainability values. Furthermore, the study implements a novel approach that determines how and in what order the sustainability functions of Industry 4.0 should be leveraged to promote the sustainability objectives of Industry 5.0. Results reveal that Industry 4.0 has benefited economic and environmental sustainability values most at the organisational and supply chain levels. Nonetheless, most micro and meso-social sustainability values have been adversely impacted by Industry 4.0. Similarly, Industry 4.0 has been worryingly detrimental to macro sustainability values like social or economic growth equality. These contradictory implications of Industry 4.0 have pulled the Industry 5.0 agenda. However, the results identified nine sustainability functions of Industry 4.0 that, when leveraged appropriately and in the correct order, can offer important implications for realising the economic and socio-environmental goals of Industry 5.0. For example, under extreme unpredictability of business world uncertainties, the business should first leverage the automation and integration capabilities of Industry 4.0 to gain the necessary cost-saving, resource efficiency, risk management capability, and business antifragility that allow them to introduce sustainable innovation into their business model without jeopardising their survival. Various scenarios for empowering Industry 5.0 sustainability values identified in the present study offer important implications for knowledge and practice.\n",

      "Implementation of digital twin-enabled virtually monitored data in inspection planning\n",
      "Marine structures are subjected to cyclic wave loads in ocean environments, leading to progressive forms of structural degradation such as fatigue cracks. To ensure fitness-for-service of these critical assets, there has been increasing interest in the application of digital twin-enabled virtual monitoring techniques. Whilst numerous studies have focused on computational algorithms dedicated to virtual monitoring, little effort has been devoted to establishing a practical digital-to-physical connection and decision-making based on virtually monitored data. This paper bridges this research gap by proposing an approach for implementing digital twin-enabled virtually monitored data in inspection planning for marine structures. The inspection of fatigue-prone structural components plays a crucial role in structural integrity management. Reliability-informed inspection, which employs a probabilistic approach that prioritises inspections based on probability of failure, offers a cost-effective approach by avoiding unnecessary inspections and reducing life-cycle costs. However, conducting a comprehensive structural reliability analysis requires thorough knowledge of the actual operational profile and current state of a structure (e.g. consumed fatigue life) in order to accurately predict its future performance (e.g. remaining fatigue life). Although design specifications and assumptions can serve as guidelines, a high degree of uncertainty may arise due to the discrepancy between the actual operational profile and the design assumptions. The approach developed in this paper consists of four main elements: virtual monitoring, data-driven forecasting, fatigue reliability, and inspection planning. This provides a practical means for establishing a connection between condition monitoring and assessment in the digital world and decision-making in the physical world. An illustrative numerical example is then presented to demonstrate the application of the proposed framework. Finally, avenues for future research and developments in this field are discussed.\n",

      "The COVID-19 pandemic and the Russian–Ukrainian war have significantly impacted global supply chains, including the food supply chain, in numerous countries. As one of the leading wheat importers, Egypt has been adversely affected by the simultaneous occurrence of these two events. Baladi bread is an integral part of the daily diet in Egypt, so any disruption affecting its availability can have a severe impact on the country’s food security. This study aims to simulate the causes and effects of potential disruptions that could occur, such as increased transportation time, unavailability of sourcing, and surge in demand due to lockdowns and panic buying. The East Cairo region was chosen as a case study to model the Baladi bread supply chain. A discrete-event simulation model was developed using anyLogistix software (version 2.15.1) for this study. Five key performance indicators were selected to evaluate, analyze, and compare the outcomes of each scenario in terms of the performance and operation of the food supply chain: service level by product, lead time, demand backlog, average daily available inventory in the mills, and on-hand inventory of wheat in the silos. The results indicate that the supply chain has been significantly impacted by the disruptions caused by these two events, leading to decreased availability of Baladi bread, unmet demand, extended lead times, and high backlogs. By utilizing the research findings, proactive strategies can be developed to minimize the impact of such disruptions in the future and maximize food security and supply chain resilience.\n",

      "The full deployment of sixth-generation (6G) networks is inextricably connected with a holistic network redesign able to deal with various emerging challenges, such as integration of heterogeneous technologies and devices, as well as support of latency and bandwidth demanding applications. In such a complex environment, resource optimization, and security and privacy enhancement can be quite demanding, due to the vast and diverse data generation endpoints and associated hardware elements. Therefore, efficient data collection mechanisms are needed that can be deployed at any network infrastructure. In this context, the network data analytics function (NWDAF) has already been defined in the fifth-generation (5G) architecture from Release 15 of 3GPP, that can perform data collection from various network functions (NFs). When combined with advanced machine learning (ML) techniques, a full-scale network optimization can be supported, according to traffic demands and service requirements. In addition, the collected data from NWDAF can be used for anomaly detection and thus, security and privacy enhancement. Therefore, the main goal of this paper is to present the current state-of-the-art on the role of the NWDAF towards data collection, resource optimization and security enhancement in next generation broadband networks. Furthermore, various key enabling technologies for data collection and threat mitigation in the 6G framework are identified and categorized, along with advanced ML approaches.

      "Comprehensive Review of Metaheuristic Algorithms (MAs) for Optimal Control (OCl) Improvement\n",
      "Optimal control (OCl) can be traced back to the 1960s when it was utilised for solving an optimisation problem (OP). In the OCl technique, a stable controller can be obtained by optimising a cost function (CF). This means that the performance provided by an OCl technique is the best in any instance. Nevertheless, this performance is not unique. Additionally, the parameters are not optimal. As such, there is a need to improve the technique so that the performance and the parameters are optimal. It has many applications in different fields of study such as engineering. There exist different OCl techniques such as Linear Quadratic Gaussian (LQG), Model Predictive Control (MPCl), Kalman Filter (KF), Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR), etc. LQR and LQG are among the OCl techniques that are becoming popular in the industry and the research community. These controllers can provide robust stability because of their outstanding properties. Robustness to modelling uncertainty and noise (particular to LQG), closed-loop stability, direct input control, optimal input control, etc., are some of the properties that lead to this robust stability provided by these controllers. Nevertheless, one of their major problems is the tuning method. Conventionally, these controllers are tuned using classical methods such as Bryson’s, analytical, trial-and-error, etc., methods. But these methods are associated with a lot of issues, such as time consumption, requiring experience and understanding of the problem at hand, lack of guaranteeing optimal values, etc., which lead to performance, stability, robustness, etc., problems. To solve these issues, researchers tend to use computational (optimisation) methods which proved to be more efficient. Consequently, a comprehensive state-of-the-art review of the recent studies that used computational methods for the improvement of OCl is presented in this paper. Different MAs that have been used to implement optimised LQR and LQG controls have been presented where the most used MAs are discussed in detail. The extent to which these MAs improved the control techniques is critically analysed. Additionally, optimised hybrids of these control techniques have been considered. Furthermore, the most controlled systems are discussed in detail including system modelling and state space representation derivation. The implementation modes of the techniques have been analysed. Some future research directions are also outlined. In essence, the work’s major goal is to provide a comprehensive guide for researchers on computational methods usage for OCl improvement using LQR and LQG as case studies.\n",

      "Welding is an important part in the construction process of large cruise ships. Seam tracking is essential in the welding processes to ensure the welding accuracy. To reduce seam tracking error in the process of steel sheets welding for large cruise ships, a digital-twin-based predictive compensation control strategy is proposed. Firstly, based on an analysis of ideal characteristics for welding processes, a digital-twin-based architecture of predictive compensation control for seam tracking is introduced. Then, the basic logic of predictive compensation control strategy for seam tracking is explained. In addition, a recursive grey model based on Taguchi method and sparrow search algorithm (RGMbTM-SSA) is developed to improve prediction accuracy. Finally, the accuracy of RGMbTM-SSA and the feasibility of the proposed digital-twin-based predictive compensation control strategy are verified through actual cases of steel sheets welding production for large cruise ships. The results show that in the prediction of seam tracking errors, RGMbTM-SSA performs better than some common grey models and machine learning algorithms. In the developed digital twin system for seam tracking, the comprehensive performance of predictive compensation control strategy achieves the best when the advance time is set to 2 s. The strategy proposed in this study can reduce the average over-offset number per seam by more than 60 %. Simultaneously, approximately 20 % of average offsets can be reduced. Digital-twin-based predictive compensation control strategy enriches the methods of seam tracking, and it can significantly improve the quality of welding seams.\n",

The research conclusions indicate that the adoption of AI technology by heterogeneous ports can enhance port profits. Unfortunately, simultaneous adoption exacerbates homogenized competition, posing a threat to profit realization. Furthermore, while the hub port can leverage AI-empowered capabilities to strengthen own competitiveness, it can undermine the performance of competitors and society at large.

      "Probabilistic estimates of ice impact loading on the propulsion systems of vessels designed to operate in polar waters are necessary to assess the adequacy of current design specifications. Over the course of 13 days of operations in sea ice, high frequency inboard shaft line deformation measurements were recorded aboard the SA Agulhas II, a polar supply and research vessel, and inversion of the dataset performed to determine ice loading on the propeller. The inversion method filters out resonant vibration of the propulsion shaft around its natural frequency, and is implemented as a rapid algorithm developed for application to long time series full voyage data as well as real-time monitoring. Extreme value analysis of inferred ice-induced impact loading in active ice navigation was conducted to obtain Weibull and Gumbel distribution parameters for 1-second interval ice loading maxima. The resulting annual exceedance probability curves indicate that the loading specification used in the design of the propulsion systems for the SA Agulhas II implies a 1×10−5 to 5×10−5 probability of exceedance during a year of regular operations. These quantitative probabilistic reference values for the ice-induced impact loading exposure of a polar vessel operating in first-year and multi-year sea ice conditions represent information of key significance to propulsion design of future polar vessels.\n",

      "The paper is devoted to underlining the important role of monitoring systems in the sustainable development of seaport areas—sensitive ocean–land connections exposed to the harmful effects of multimodal transport. The study concerns the existing monitoring possibilities of the environmental factors and ship traffic near port infrastructure. The main aim of the study is presenting the example of solutions, supporting the sustainable development of port areas, related to the most dangerous ship maneuvering operations carried out near the berths. An indirect method for measuring loads on the seabed from the propeller and thruster jets during ship berthing and an experimental method for predicting the hydrodynamic forces generated on a moored Panamax-size bulk carrier by a similar vessel passing along in shallow water conditions are described in the context of their implementation in monitoring systems. The cloud-based system—installed in the ferry terminal in the Port of Gdynia and developed for monitoring the flow generated by the ship propellers during maneuvers near the berth and warning about the exceedance of allowable pressure on the quay wall—allows, after a two-year operation, to draw the conclusions related to maintenance planning and has an impact on port sustainability. The discussion presented in the paper underlines the influence of monitoring both the environmental elements and hazardous ship operations on the sustainable development of seaport areas.\n",

      "Probabilistic estimation of directional wave spectrum using onboard measurement data\n",
      "Ocean wave spectrum is the key to the response estimation of seagoing vessel whose structural integrity is of utmost importance. Efforts have been made by researchers to correctly estimate the ocean wave spectrum using so called ‘wave-buoy analogy’ concept, where the vessel is considered to behave as a wave buoy. The aim of this study is to develop a methodology through which the directional wave spectrum can be estimated using the concept of ‘wave-buoy analogy’. To achieve the objective, ocean wave was modeled with 10-parameter bimodal wave spectrum combining long- and short-wave component. These 10 parameters of bimodal wave spectrum were targeted by solving non-linear least square problem, which is formulated by error function quantifying the difference between model prediction and onboard measurement data. Model prediction is based on the linear relationship between the wave spectrum and response spectra and measurement data are directly from the sensors installed on the vessel. To solve the non-linear least square problem, Bayesian statistics-based probabilistic approaches, Markov-Chain Monte Carlo simulation (MCMC), were utilized. Well-known adaptive Metropolis–Hastings algorithm which is one of the most popularly used MCMC techniques was utilized to derive the spectrum parameters that best describe the directional wave spectrum. To validate the proposed methodology, pseudo measurement data generated by numerical analysis with different loading conditions were used. The application of the proposed methodology to the numerical analysis data confirmed that it accurately estimates the response at locations where sensors are not installed.\n",

Based on the ideas of stochastic gradient identification and multi-innovation theory, a multi-innovation stochastic gradient (MI-SG) algorithm is derived for parameter identification of the ship–wave discretion model. Maximum likelihood theory is introduced to propose a maximum likelihood-based multi-innovation stochastic gradient (ML-MI-SG) algorithm.

The missing or inadequate presentation of significant information, such as the vessel’s primary engine model, critically affects its capabilities and operating expenses as well as its environmental impact. In this study, a comprehensive study was employed, using and comparing several machine learning classification techniques to classify a ship’s main engine model, along with different imputation methods for handling the missing values and dimensionality reduction methods. The classification is based on the technical and operational characteristics of the vessel, including the physical dimensions, various capacities, speeds and consumption. Briefly, three dimensionality reduction methods (Principal Component Analysis, Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection, and t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding) were considered and combined with a variety of classifiers and the appropriate parameters of the dimensionality reduction methods. According to the classification results, the ExtraTreeClassifier with PCA with 4 components, the ExtraTreeClassifier with t-SNE with perplexity equal to 10 and 3 components, and the same classifier with UMAP with 10 neighbors and 3 components outperformed the rest of the combinations. This classification could provide significant information for shipowners to enhance the vessel’s operation by optimizing it.\n",

      "Semantically Enhanced System and Automation Design of Complex Marine Vessels\n",
      "To integrate and assist the system and automation design phases of complex marine vessels, this paper proposes a two-level semantically enhanced scheme. At the design level, the system components are described and automatically connected by a developed graph-making tool using semantic “knowledge”. Decisions regarding the system selection are made based on certain Quality of Service Criteria (QoS) and enforced in the final semantic database using a dedicated cognitive agent. The automation level leverages the selected systems semantic information with that of the associated automation components and reuses the graph-making tool to update the connection graph. The resulting knowledge-graph is then used to “reason” for the creation of feasible closed-loop control architectures while a cognitive agent determines which closed-loop architecture to use based on various QoS criteria. The chosen closed-loop architecture can then change in an online manner during the vessel operation in case that system reconfiguration is required either due to malfunctioning components, or aiming to satisfy mission's goals. The applicability and efficiency of the proposed method are shown using a case study for marine propulsion.\n",

      "Driven by the IoT technology and smart sensors development in Industry 5.0, the digital twin as an innovative information technology brings new opportunities and challenges for intelligent maritime logistics management. This paper tries to present a systematic review on digital twin-empowered smart maritime logistics management by employing a bibliometric analysis framework under the Industry 5.0 era. The 3372 related publications from the Web of Science database are collected as research samples from 2003 to 2023. Besides, the VosViewer is adopted to perform the co-word and network analysis by visualizing interactive collaborations of published literature. Specifically, more than 3,000 articles on maritime logistics were reviewed to determine the research trajectories and main themes through same-word study and co-citation analysis. Results show that most publications on maritime logistics management are concentrated in China and the United States, where maritime logistics is developing towards digitization and informatization. In particular, Sustainability, Maritime Policy & Management, and Journal of Marine Science and Engineering are the most important journals focusing on maritime logistics management. Moreover, we hope this review study serves as a future direction on digital twin-empowered smart maritime logistics management practices for both researchers and practitioners.\n",

      "Speed optimization for maximizing the ship's economic benefits considering the Carbon Intensity Indicator (CII)\n",
      "With the introduction and imposition of the Carbon Intensity Indicator (CII) guidelines, more and more attention is being given to CII compliance of ships. A ship’s normal operation will be affected when it has a CII rating of D or E. However, pursuing lower energy consumption may reduce economic benefits, which is a major concern for stakeholders. This paper proposes a method to maximum a ship’s economic benefits while meeting the CII requirements. An optimization model is established by reallocating the proportions of different speed ranges and adjusting the corresponding average values. A genetic algorithm is adopted to solve the proposed model. The results of a case study based on real ship data demonstrate 5% to 8% improvements in annual full load distance after optimization while maintaining a CII rating of C or better in a given year. The proposed optimization model should be able to provide guidance for operational decision-making under increasingly stringent CII regulations.\n",

      "Emergency disposal is a critical aspect for railway stations to ensure safety. This requires the implementation of emergency plan simulations and cost-effective immersive drills. In the paper, we incorporate a set of disposals for events into emergency processes and model the personnel, supplies, and equipment to create multiple emergency scenarios. Additionally, we introduce a digital twin-based solution for multiple scenarios of emergencies. This solution completely restores the key components of a station in the information space and provides an immersive way for emergency disposals. The four-dimensional model used in the solution simulates and interacts with the station, and it is composed of the details of passenger station physical entity, multi-scenario emergency virtual entity, digital twin connection, and emergency twin service. The digital twin for versatile emergency events such as fire disaster, natural disaster (e.g., flood, earthquake), social security incident, and public health event have been constructed using the model. The solution was tested at Qinghe, a station during Beijing-Zhangjiakou high-speed railway in China. By utilizing the actual operation data of Qinghe, we validated the multi-scenario emergency drills, simulated the corresponding emergency disposal plans, and assessed the proposed solution from three aspects: the fidelity of the real-world simulation, coverage of the multiple emergency scenarios, and the user-friendliness. The evaluations indicate that the proposed solution attains good score and the acceptable level of system usability scale.\n",

      "The utilization of automatic mooring systems is under extensive interest with the growing technological demands for autonomous ships and smart ports. A vacuum suction pad with a rubber seal, which endures external loads to the moored ship, such as mooring forces, is a critical element in an automatic mooring system. To develop a high-performance automatic mooring system, a vacuum suction pad and a rubber seal need to be thoroughly designed, manufactured, and evaluated. This work demonstrates a protocol for evaluating the performance of a vacuum suction pad through both simulation and experimental testing. Uniaxial tensile testing was conducted to understand the mechanical behavior of a rubber seal. Stabilized stress-strain curves were utilized to find an optimal strain energy density function model and to extract material parameters for 3D finite element method (FEM) simulations. The FEM simulations were conducted to calculate strain distributions, contact status and the maximum load capacity, and along with the FEM simulation results, experimental evaluations of the vacuum suction pad were designed and conducted against static and cyclic loads. Based on the simulation and experimental results, we can conclude that the vacuum suction pad can maintain the stable suction at least up to 25 kN suitable for the use in automatic mooring systems.\n",

      "Digital Twins in the Context of Seaports and Terminal Facilities\n",
      "Increasing freight volumes and challenging environments in seaports and container terminals worldwide require streamlined and reliable operations. Digital twins are seen as important drivers of the digitalization in seaports by providing a basis for higher transparency, control and data-driven decision making. In this context, however, the concept is rarely studied, and implementation issues are not comprehensively discussed. The paper presents an exploratory study of digital twins in seaports based on a literature review and case studies. The analysis reveals a standardization deficit for digital twin implementations, an inflationary and improper use of the term digital twin, and fields of research that need to be explored further. The application of optimization methods and the integration of simulation-based optimization in the field of seaports and container terminals is examined, due to its relevance for digital twins. Important lessons learned can be taken from the most advanced implementations, integrating simulations and emulations with optimization methods. An in-depth examination of multiple case studies and discussions with global port leaders yields valuable perspectives on the varied levels of digital twin implementations being applied today, including insights into the most advanced implementations currently being used in ports and container terminals. As a result of the analyses conducted, various research directions and a research agenda are presented.\n",

      "Lightweight and fast visual detection method for 3C assembly\n",
      "In the context of 3C assembly scenarios, characterized by numerous semi-flexible, heterogeneous, and small slender targets, traditional target detection algorithms face significant challenges such as low accuracy, weak generalization, large model sizes, and slow inference speeds. To address these issues, this study introduces an enhanced method based on the YOLOv5 model, named YOLOv5-GTB. This method integrates Bidirectional Feature Pyramid Network (BiFPN), Ghost lightweight convolution, Vision Transformer (ViT), and adaptive activation function technologies, aiming to improve the accuracy and speed of target detection. Our approach utilizes Ghost convolution to construct a Ghost bottleneck layer, optimizing the feature extraction network while significantly reducing computational costs and enhancing the convolutional neural network’s feature extraction capabilities. Additionally, the Cross-Stage Partial Network (CSPNet) architecture is employed to effectively segment the data flow of the input feature map layer, thereby improving the efficiency of gradient processing. Furthermore, we introduce a fusion structure of CNN and Transformer, leveraging the strengths of convolutional neural networks in local feature extraction and the ViT’s capability in long-range information capture, thereby further enhancing the overall network’s feature extraction performance. Regarding feature fusion, considering the limitations of traditional top-down unidirectional information flow in effectively merging features with both location and semantic information, BiFPN is incorporated into the YOLOv5-GTB. This enhances the fusion of feature layers extracted from both the end of the backbone network and the first module’s fused feature layer, thus improving detection accuracy. Ablation and comparative experiments conducted on the 3C assembly scenario target detection dataset demonstrate the significant advantages of the YOLOv5-GTB model in terms of accuracy and speed. Ultimately, the application of this model to the 3C assembly platform successfully achieves rapid and accurate target recognition in this scenario.\n",

      "Due to increasing environmental concerns and global energy demand, the development of Floating Offshore Wind Turbines (FOWTs) is on the rise. FOWTs offer a promising solution to expand wind farm deployment into deeper waters with abundant wind resources. However, their harsh operating conditions and lower maturity level compared to fixed structures pose significant engineering challenges, notably in the design phase. A critical challenge is the time-consuming hydromechanics analysis traditionally done using computationally intensive Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) models. In this study, we introduce Artificial Intelligence-based surrogate models using state-of-the-art Machine Learning algorithms. These surrogate models achieve CFD-level accuracy (within 3% difference) while dramatically reducing computational requirements from minutes to milliseconds. Specifically, we build a surrogate model for characterizing the hydrodynamic response of a floating spar-type offshore wind turbine (including added mass, radiation damping matrices, and hydrodynamic excitation) using computationally efficient shallow Machine Learning models, optimizing the trade-off between computational efficiency and accuracy, based on data generated by a cutting-edge potential-flow code.\n",

      "The logistics industry is undergoing a profound transformation to cope with the fundamental changes in customer expectations and the need for digitalization imposed by the pandemic, changes in the socio-economic world, and technology. This research paper addresses the use of Digital Twins in the logistics industry at the network, site, and asset levels. There is no single definition of a Digital Twins framework for logistics twins in academic and industry practice, so a scientific method allows for investigation from an exploratory perspective. Data/fact findings were conducted in two ways: (1) in-depth interviews with experts from academia, ICT organizations, and key players in the logistics industry; (2) academic publications, industry reports, and written and media content from established national and international organizations. This paper proposes a conceptual Digital Twins framework for logistics (DTLs). This paper clarifies DTL concepts and defines an implementation from academic and practical points of view. It thoroughly explores actual use cases of DTLs to validate the concept and optimize its implementation. This paper explains how DTLs work and add value to businesses. In doing so, it outlines different technological requirements for solutions and logistical performance objectives when implementing different levels of DTLs. This paper focuses on Fifth-Party Logistics Providers (5 PLs) due to their complexity and the fact that they are becoming increasingly important and relatively widespread. This paper combines academic and industry perspectives to gain a shared understanding of DTLs as an entire logistics value chain in the case of 5 PLs. It provides a practical reference for researchers and practitioners to facilitate discussion on DTLs.\n",

      "A clean solar hydrail, a locomotive operated by solar and hydrogen energy, has received significant attention as an alternative to a current fossil fuel-based locomotive. Nevertheless, the feasibility test of solar hydrail is still challenging since it has not yet been practically developed. Herein, we employed digital twin technology to design and operate solar hydrail and diesel locomotive. 30 years of operation simulation starting from 2021 was conducted based on the data of Gangwon-do, South Korea. It was confirmed that replacing the single diesel locomotive with solar hydrail can provide about 59 % lower net present cost and annual harmful emission reduction of approximately 300 tons. Sensitivity analyses were also conducted to mitigate future uncertainty, and the solar hydrail was a better option than the diesel locomotive in every scenario. This study demonstrates that solar hydrail is the successful substitute for the diesel locomotive currently operated in South Korea.\n",

      "The dynamic and complex environment affects the operational efficiency of automated guided vehicles (AGVs) at automated container terminals, in which artificial intelligent approaches are applied to address optimization problems in dynamic systems. This paper proposes a digital twin-based decision support approach to improve the efficiency of AGV scheduling service. Accordingly, the factors that affect AGV scheduling performance, including conflicts, failures, and battery constraints, are discussed first. Then, the framework and main steps of the proposed approach are described. The physical operation space is mapped into the virtual space, and both spaces keep synchronized to support the verification of solutions. A mathematical programming model and Q-learning algorithm are used to generate the AGV scheduling plan considering battery charging. Numerical experiments are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. Comparisons of the digital twin-based approach, genetic algorithm (GA), and particle swarm optimization (PSO) are also made with different scale experiments. It appears that the proposed digital twin-based approach is superior to GA and PSO when solving small- and large-scale cases. A sensitivity analysis is performed concerning the battery utilization rate, task, and AGV number. Experimental results show that an optimal configuration of AGV and task can improve the battery utilization rate and reduce the completion time.\n",

      "Liquefied natural gas (LNG) is widely regarded as the midterm solution toward zero-carbon transportation at sea. However, further applications of gas engines are challenging due to their weak dynamic load performance. Therefore, the comprehension of and improvements in the dynamic performance of gas-engine-based power systems are necessary and urgent. A detailed review of research on mechanisms, modeling, and optimization is indispensable to summarize current studies and solutions. Developments in engine air-path systems and power system load control have been summarized and compared. Mechanism studies and modeling methods for engine dynamic performance were investigated and concluded considering the trade-off between precision and simulation cost. Beyond existing studies, this review provides insights into the challenges and potential pathways for future applications in decarbonization and energy diversification. For further utilization of clean fuels, like ammonia and hydrogen, the need for advanced air–fuel ratio control becomes apparent. These measures should be grounded in a deep understanding of current gas engines and the combustion characteristics of new fuels. Additionally, the inherent low inertia feature of electric power systems, and consequently the weak dynamic performance when adopting renewable energies, must be considered and studied to ensure system reliability and safety during transient conditions.\n",

      "A Bi-Level Programming Approach to Optimize Ship Fouling Cleaning\n",
      "Ship fouling has significant adverse effects on vessel performance and environmental sustainability. Therefore, this research study develops a bi-level programming model to simultaneously optimize cleaning equipment deployment by cleaning service providers in the upper level and cleaning decisions by shipping companies in the lower level. To address the interaction within the bi-level problem, the model is transformed into a single-level formulation using the big-M method. This transformation greatly simplifies the complexity of the computation and reduces computation time. Numerical experiments are conducted using real-world data to evaluate the performance of the proposed models. In addition, sensitivity analyses are performed to investigate the influence of key parameters. The results indicate that cleaning service providers primarily purchase equipment in the first year based on the demand distribution. To maximize profit, they may choose to forgo a portion of the demand. The sensitivity analysis reveals that sacrificing part of the demand can lead to an additional USD 27 million in profits compared with satisfying all demand. Moreover, increasing the cleaning price reduces both demand and equipment purchases but increases total profits. Conversely, increasing purchase costs reduces profits and the total amount of equipment purchased. When service providers can no longer generate profits, they are likely to exit the market. These findings offer valuable insights for service providers and shipping companies in the practical deployment of cleaning equipment and foul cleaning decisions, respectively.\n",

      "In recent years, the concept of autonomous navigation systems has gained substantial significance, with the potential to change the traditional concept of autonomous navigation. The presented numerical simulation investigates the feasibility of a ship’s autonomous navigation system through a laser communication infrastructure handled by a two-degrees-of-freedom (DoFs) acquisition, tracking and pointing (ATP) system able to enable ship–satellite data transmission. The methodology introduced presents the geometrical and kinematic delineation of the model, coupled with the implemented control system, aimed at assessing the pointing accuracy. The minimum requested pointing accuracy is 100 µrad and the analysis highlights the need of using methodologies to reduce the pointing error. Two approaches are investigated to examine a possible improvement of the system, and results show that the pointing phase is influenced less by ship motions and more by errors that occur during the satellite’s positioning and the ship motion acquisition process. A trade-off in choosing parameters to improve the system’s accuracy leads to a satellite’s first targeting time of 0.25 s alongside the probability of hitting the target once every 0.0013 s. The reliability of the system is evaluated through a brief sizing of the optical electromechanical component of the system using the trade-off parameters chosen to improve the pointing phase accuracy.\n",

      "A predicting method for the mechanical property response of the marine riser based on the simulation and data-driven models\n",
      "The accurate and real-time prediction of the mechanical property response for the safety assessment of the marine riser is necessary during offshore oil and gas production. However, a finite element simulation is time-consuming, which obstructs the real-time monitoring and evaluation of the marine riser. Therefore, to obtain the real-time mechanical response of the marine riser, a predicting method based on the simulation and data-driven models is proposed. To obtain the prediction data, the finite element simulation model under the typical working conditions is established by the Abaqus software, and then the sensitivity analysis of influence factors is conducted due to the varied working conditions. The orthogonal experimental method is used to select the typical working conditions of the marine riser, and the selection of the sensitive influence factors is ensured based on the typical working conditions, the range analysis, and the grey relational method. To obtain enough training data, the Latin hypercube sampling method is used to enlarge the data for the analysis process. To find a more reliable prediction algorithm, four typical single surrogate models, which are the polynomial response surface model, the radial basis model, the kriging model, and the support vector machine regression model, are selected to establish a predicting model library. Meanwhile, a combining surrogate model, including the average weight surrogate model and the adaptive weight surrogate model, is established based on the combining weight to further improve the predicting accuracy. As a result, an optimal surrogate model is selected from the above four single and two combining surrogate models based on four evaluation criteria including the mean absolute percentage error, the mean absolute error, the root mean square error, and the goodness of fit. The cases show that the optimal surrogate model has a highly rapid response, with average relative errors are 8.17%, 3.42%, and 11.40% for the maximum bending moment, the maximum equivalent stress, and the maximum lateral deformation, respectively. In the above study, the accurate and reliable prediction method of the mechanical property responses will provide a theoretical basis for ensuring the safety of the marine riser.\n",

In this paper, we introduce an innovative digital twin-based method for diagnosing faults in autonomous ships. Our digital twin system collects data from the ship’s sensor array, conducts comprehensive analysis, computes fault parameters, and provides real-time visualizations of the findings. To achieve this, we utilize the ship’s dynamical model and employ a novel adaptive extended Kalman filter (AEKF) algorithm to estimate the severity of these faults. We evaluate the effectiveness of this approach through numerical simulations and practical implementation in an autonomous surface vehicle called the Otter, developed by Maritime Robotics. The experimental results, which consider both normal and faulty ship propulsion systems, underscore the significant potential of this novel approach to improve ship condition monitoring during operational activities.\n",

      "As a fundamental transportation mode, maritime logistics has become an indispensable component on a global scale. However, there are multiple drawbacks associated with ports operating in traditional ways, such as higher cost, lower efficiency and generating more environmental pollution. Digital technologies have been researched and implemented gradually in green ports, especially in data collection and real-time monitoring, and these advances help to promote higher work efficiency and reduce detrimental environmental impacts. It was found that green ports (e.g. ports of Raffina, Los Angeles, and Long Beach) generally perform better in energy conservation and pollutant emission reduction. However, considering the variability in the level of digitalization, there are challenges in achieving effective communications between individual ports. Therefore, to optimize and update green port practices, a systematic review is necessary to comprehensively analyze the beneficial contributions of green ports. This review adopted bibliometric analysis to examine the shipping framework focusing on green ports digitalization and innovation. After that, with regards to the bibliometric results, five aspects were analyzed, including environment, performance, policy, technology, and management. Besides, intelligent life-cycle management was systematically discussed to improve green ports and maritime logistics performance and sustainability in three aspects, namely waste discharge, shipping management system and green ports management. The findings revealed that green ports and maritime logistics require digital cooperation, transformation, and management to achieve sustainable development goals, including route selection and control of ships' numbers, weather prediction, and navigational effluent monitoring, albeit with some obstacles.\n",

Moreover, research object and characteristics of DT in maritime industry are categorized and discussed. The research objects of DT in the maritime industry are classified into ships, marine structures, underwater vehicles and marine engines. The characteristics of the maritime industry DT models are discussed in terms of target system, research contribution and simulation method. In addition, DT in the context of product life-cycle perspective in the maritime industry is analyzed and discussed in terms of design, manufacturing, operation, and maintenance phases. Based on our analysis and discussion of the research, we found that the current DT research in the maritime sector is mainly focused on relatively small modules, or small systems, or even only on individual components. In addition, only a small fraction of the reviewed DT-related papers focuses on the whole life-cycle in the maritime industry. The reason may come from that the models and sub-models are not yet flexible and adaptive enough at different life-cycle stages. Therefore, we believe that the development of DT technology is still in the developmental stage in the maritime industry.\n",

MCE empowers shipyards to deal effectively with waste, bottlenecks, and disruptions, thereby increasing performance, competitiveness, and profitability. Using a comprehensive approach that uses both qualitative and quantitative methods, including field surveys, and in-depth interviews in the traditional shipyard industry, this research identifies Nonvalue-Added (NVA) processes, conducts process mapping, and calculates MCE. The findings reported in this article underscore the significant wastage in the production process, indicating an urgent need for improvement, given the current average MCE value of 67.08%, indicating considerable room for improvement. This article provides innovative perspectives on optimizing the traditional shipyard industry through production cycle efficiencies while offering actionable recommendations. Key focus areas include integrating management systems, adopting advanced technologies, and implementing sustainable strategies to improve MCE, especially by reducing nonvalue-added time wastage, such as inspection and storage. By implementing strategies that optimize production, minimize waste, and overcome the challenges of global competition, this research contributes to improving MCE. In conclusion, this study is an invaluable guide for industry stakeholders, enabling them to enhance their competitiveness and adapt effectively to a dynamic business environment.\n",

      "Wavelet Neural Network-Based Half-Period Predictive Roll-Reduction Control Using a Fin Stabilizer at Zero Speed\n",
      "Among the commonly used ship-stabilizing devices, the fin stabilizer is the most effective. Since the lift force of the conventional fin stabilizer is proportional to the square of the incoming flow velocity, it has a better anti-rolling effect at higher speeds but a poor anti-rolling effect at low speeds and even no effect at zero speed. A combination of modelling analysis, simulation, and a model ship experiment is used in this paper to study the zero-speed roll-reduction control problem of the fin stabilizer. A simulation model of the rolling motion of a polar expedition ship is established. The lift model of the fin stabilizer at zero speed is established using the theory of fluid mechanics. The proportional–integral–differential (PID) controller is selected to control the fin to achieve zero-speed roll reduction. To obtain a better anti-rolling control effect under variable sea conditions, a wavelet neural network (WNN)-based half-period prediction algorithm is adopted to update and adjust PID control parameters in real time. A simulation was carried out, and the effectiveness of the proposed predictive control algorithm is proved. A reduced-scale ship model was established to carry out the water tank experiment, and the results verify the theoretical analysis and simulation. The results also verify the effectiveness of the proposed control strategy.\n",

      "Digital twins (DTs) promise innovation for the marine renewable energy sector using modern technological advances and the existing maritime knowledge frameworks. The DT is a digital equivalent of a real object that reflects and predicts its behaviours and states in a virtual space over its lifetime. DTs collect data from multiple sources in pilots and leverage newly introduced low-cost sensor systems. They synchronize, homogenize, and transmit the data to a central hub and integrate it with predictive and learning models to optimize plant performance and operations. This research presents critical aspects of DT implementation challenges in marine energy digitalization DT approaches that use and combine data systems. Firstly, the DT and the existing framework for marine knowledge provided by systems are presented, and the DT's main development steps are discussed. Secondly, the DT implementing main stages, measurement systems, data harmonization and preprocessing, modelling, comprehensive data analysis, and learning and optimization tools, are identified. Finally, the ILIAD (Integrated Digital Framework for Comprehensive Maritime Data and Information Services) project has been reviewed as a best EU funding practice to understand better how marine energy digitalization DT's approaches are being used, designed, developed, and launched.\n",

      "Smart fault diagnosis of bearings is of great significance due to their extensive applications on various occasions. Recently, self-powered sensing technology based on triboelectric nanogenerators promotes the development of intelligent bearings. However, the effective detection and recognition of the rolling element defects of bearings need to be investigated further. This study proposes a triboelectric sensor-embedded rolling bearing (T-bearing) to monitor the working conditions and conduct the defect diagnosis of rolling balls. The interdigitated copper electrode covered by polytetrafluoroethylene film is attached to the inner surface of the outer ring of a commercial bearing. Such a design not only directly forms the TENG with rolling balls to obtain the contact-sensing signals, but also successfully achieves the diagnosis of rolling ball defects with similar triboelectric signals through a novel analysis and prediction paradigm combining signal decomposition and automated machine learning. Finally, a recognition accuracy of 99.48% with five different conditions of bearing balls is reached, which is extremely superior to the highest accuracy of 78.34% without signal decomposition. Thus, this study provides a new strategy for the defect diagnosis and the intelligent application of triboelectric bearings.\n",

      "Controller tuning plays an important role when designing or adjusting a control system. Using a model for that purpose is more convenient than tuning the controller on a real system, especially for the case of remote assistance. It can be performed on model using various methods, therefore, it is necessary to evaluate the performance of the model using available methods for the case study. Flow control is one of the most common processes on board a ship, therefore it is worth evaluating the performances of the model for the ship digital twin applications. The aim of this paper is to evaluate the previously developed transfer function model using common well-known tuning methods, in order to get a clear insight in the model applicability for the purpose of controller tuning and to determine the optimal method for that purpose. By analyzing the response of the system with different controller parameters, it is possible to make a conclusion about the performance of the model, as well as the conclusion about the tuning methods.

      "To ensure the safety of ship navigation, a regular hull inspection is essential, which can identify affected structures and guide the appropriate maintenance. Traditional hull inspections severely rely on inspectors who tour the entire hull and perform close inspections, which are tedious, subjective, dangerous and expensive. The applications of computer algorithms and robots to data processing and data collection respectively have been receiving increasing attention, to facilitate hull inspections and reduce costs. In this paper, we first review the background knowledge of hull inspection. Then we categorize different inspection approaches into three classes: in-dock, underwater and health monitoring based inspections and conduct an extensive, deep survey. In addition to manual inspection approaches, we survey both the automatic data processing methods and automated platforms used to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of hull inspection. Different approaches are reviewed based on the type of Non-destructive Testing (NDT) techniques, data processing methods and automated platforms. Discussions are further made regarding the existing work. To our knowledge, this study is the first survey performed in such an extensive manner, which can help both the research and industry colleagues build up an overall understanding of hull inspection and identify potential directions for future development.\n",

      "Material selection is a crucial aspect in the design of reliable, efficient and long-lasting wave energy converters (WECs). However, to date, the development of tailored methodologies applied to the material selection of WECs remains vastly unexplored. In this paper, a material selection framework for the case of lift-based WECs is developed. The application of the methodology is demonstrated with the hydrofoils of the device. Offshore steel, high-strength offshore steel, aluminium alloys, and carbon- and glass-fibre-reinforced composites are considered and evaluated subject to relevant criteria for wave energy converters, namely structural reliability, hydrodynamic efficiency, offshore maintainability, total manufacturing cost and environmental impact. Candidate materials are assessed via fuzzy TOPSIS for three scenarios of the life cycle of the WEC: conceptual, commercial and future projection stages. Results show that the choice of optimal materials could change from present to future and that multi-criteria decision-making tools aided by a fuzzy approach are useful design tools for novel WECs when field data are scarce. Hence, methodologies such as the ones presented in this work can help in reducing the probability of mechanical failures of emerging WEC technology.\n",

      "The digital twin concept proves to be highly advantageous for smart ships as it allows the digital model to adapt in real time with changes in the physical ship. The mean value engine model (MVEM) is investigated with three different compressor mass flow rate models: a 2D interpolation model (2D), an experience-based M-JENSEN (MJ) model, and a physics-based Kang Song (KS) model. Each model is studied on a MAN 7S80ME engine with ABB A270 turbochargers. The root-mean-square errors (RMSE) for the test data are approximately 2.5 \\({\\mathrm{m}}^{3}/\\mathrm{s}\\) for the 2D model, 2.8 \\({\\mathrm{m}}^{3}/\\mathrm{s}\\) for the KS model, and 0.56 \\({\\mathrm{m}}^{3}/\\mathrm{s}\\) for the MJ model. For the training data, the RMSEs are around 0.0, 3.0, and 0.69 \\({\\mathrm{m}}^{3}/\\mathrm{s}\\), respectively. When coupling each model to the MVEM, it is observed that the calculated values differ only in the turbocharger speed. The RMREs under steady-state processes are 0.54% for MVEM with the 2D model, 1.63% for MVEM with the KS model, and 0.48% for MVEM with the MJ model. Under dynamic processes where the engine load is changed from 100% to 80%, the RMREs are 1.59%, 2.40%, and 1.58%, respectively. Among the studied models, the 2D model exhibits instability, the MJ model shows the highest accuracy, while the KS model performs the worst. However, all models demonstrate comparable results when used in the MVEM. Moreover, the physics-based KS model is a favorable choice for digital twin applications due to its excellent extrapolation ability and low dependence on measured data.\n",

Given the large number of external actions and the riser complex response, riser engineering is typically affected by several uncertain parameters, therefore an accurate monitoring of its integrity is key to ensure safe operations in the short-term and gain the necessary knowledge in the medium to long-term thus enabling design optimization, asset maintenance and life extension.

      "Sea-based rescue organizations play a vital role in maritime civil security by resolving offshore emergencies, securing sea routes, and monitoring critical naval infrastructure. However, increasing marine traffic makes rescue operations more difficult, demanding better organization and orchestration of available resources. Therefore, ensuring efficient maintenance, availability and timely deployment of rescue cruisers is of great importance, particularly in rough sea conditions. To achieve this, we design an AI-based system for predictive maintenance and condition monitoring that enables real-time analyses of the ship’s sensory data and the detection of anomalies in the system behavior. In this paper, we detail our software and hardware architecture for these purposes, and we discuss the respective requirements regarding onboard and off-ship data analysis from various data sources (sensor data, camera data, weather data). We underpin our approach by emulating data flows derived from sensory data. Finally, we provide the first results in AI-based anomaly detection, allowing, for instance, early engine malfunctions identification before the actual failure occurs.\n",

      "As technologies such as eco-friendly ships, electric propulsion vessels, and multi-fuel propulsion systems advance, the scope of IoT applications in maritime fields is expanding, resulting in increased complexity in control factors. The gradual progression towards Maritime Autonomous Surface Ships (MASS) is further driving the evolution of ship-based IoT applications. These advancements underscore the necessity for a platform capable of ensuring reliable connectivity between ships and onshore. The limitations of the existing single cloud architecture become evident in this context. In response to these emerging challenges, this paper presents a cloud-based data platform structure anchored in the architecture of a multi-region fog cloud. Concurrently, we propose a strategic approach aimed at enhancing collision avoidance performance. This is achieved through the seamless sharing of navigation plan data among ships facilitated by the proposed platform structure. In regions densely populated with ships, there looms a potential for packet loss as data traffic sharing intensifies through the platform. To address this concern, we devised a traffic model based on the AIS data generation cycle and proposed an algorithm for subscription decision. Subsequently, we conducted comparative analyses of packet loss probabilities between the single cloud structure and the multi-region fog cloud structure. This was achieved through experimental packet loss data collected via the AWS cloud. Simulation results underscored a notable difference: with 100 subscribed ships, the packet loss probability in regions assuming a single cloud was about 28 times higher compared to the same region within the multi-region fog cloud structure. These simulations affirm the stable and effective implementation of the proposed collision avoidance performance enhancement method within the multi-region fog cloud structure. Furthermore, feasibility was corroborated through the successful implementation of the proposed platform via the AWS Cloud.\n",

      "In-cylinder pressure is a key parameter for assessing marine engines health; therefore, its measurement or prediction is paramount for these engines’ diagnosis. Thermodynamic models are typically employed for predicting the in-cylinder pressure, which, however, face challenges pertinent to their calibration and computational time requirements. Recent advances in the field of machine learning have leveraged the development of data-driven models. This study aims to compare two approaches for input features and six regression techniques to select the most effective combination for developing data-driven models to predict the in-cylinder pressure of marine four-stroke engines. Two approaches with different input and output features are initially compared. The first employs regression to directly predict the in-cylinder pressure signal, whereas the second predicts the harmonics coefficients by regression and subsequently estimates the in-cylinder pressure by using a Fourier series function. Typical regression techniques, including linear, elastic, and polynomial regression, support vector machines (SVM), decision trees (DT), and artificial neural networks (ANN), are employed to develop data-driven models based on the second approach. The required datasets for training and testing are derived by using a physical digital twin for the investigated marine engine, which is calibrated against the shop trials and acquired shipboard measurements. The accuracy of the data-driven models are estimated based on the root mean square error considering the testing datasets. For the data-driven model based on the second approach and the ANN regression, a sensitivity study is carried out considering the training datasets and the harmonics number to derive recommendations for these parameters’ values. The results demonstrate that the second approach provides higher accuracy, whereas the ANN regression is the most effective technique for developing data-driven models to estimate the in-cylinder pressure, as the exhibited root mean square error is retained within \n",

      "With the advancement of deep learning (DL), researchers and engineers in the marine industry are exploring the application of DL technologies to their specific applications. In general, the accuracy of inference using DL technologies is significantly dependent on the number of training datasets. Unfortunately, people in marine science and engineering environments are often reluctant to share their documents (i.e., P&ID) with third-party manufacturers or public clouds to protect their proprietary information. Despite this, the demand for object detection using DL technologies in image-formatted files (i.e., jpg, png, or pdf format) is steadily growing. In this paper, we propose a new mechanism, called a no-training object picker (NoOP), which efficiently recognizes all objects (e.g., lines, tags, and symbols) in image-formatted P&ID documents. Notably, it can recognize objects without any training dataset, thus reducing the time and effort required for training and collection of unpublished datasets. To clearly present the effectiveness of NoOP, we evaluated NoOP using a real P&ID document. As a result, we confirmed that all objects in the image-formatted P&ID file are successfully detected over a short time (only 7.11 s on average).\n",

      "Corrosion is an undesirable phenomenon resulting in material deterioration and degradation through electrochemical or chemical reactions with the surrounding environment. Additionally, corrosion presents considerable threats in both the short and long term because of its ability to create failures, leakages, and damage to materials, equipment, and environment. Despite swift technological developments, it remains difficult to determine the degrees of corrosion due to the different textures and the edgeless boundary of corrosion surfaces. Hence, there is a need to investigate the robust corrosion detection algorithms that are suitable for all degrees of corrosion. Recently, many computer vision and image processing algorithms have been developed for corrosion prediction, assessment, and detection, such as filtering, texture, color, pixelation, image enhancement, wavelet transformation, segmentation, classification, and clustering approaches. As a result, this paper reviews and discusses the state-of-the-art computer vision and image processing methods that have been developed for corrosion detection in various applications, industries, and academic research. The challenges for corrosion detection using computer vision and image processing algorithms are also explored. Finally, recommendations for future research are also detailed.\n",

      "This study focuses on the shaft power at the neutral angle of a controllable pitch propeller to analyze the change in the required power due to propeller fouling. It is named and defined as a power for keeping propeller’s rotation (RP) because a propeller does not generate the net thrust to push the hull but dissipates the power to keep its constant speed. Statistical analysis was conducted using a decade of the observed data from a research vessel. This study assumed that the change in RP can be considered as an indicator showing the state of propeller fouling. In addition, the state of fouling on the hull can be estimated indirectly based on RP because the data correlated the shaft power under several operating conditions with RP on the same voyage. The fouling state was classified into three conditions based on RP. The comparison of shaft power at the same ship speed between the clean condition and the serious fouled condition showed that the shaft power was increased by 35% on average due to fouling. When the ship navigates under 10 knots, propeller fouling has a larger impact on the increase in shaft power than hull fouling.\n",

      "Digital twins have been developed in the oil and gas industry to support a more precise risk assessment that enables performance improvement of offshore structures throughout their life span. Usually, a floating, production, storage and offloading (FPSO) unit is required to exploit oil fields in deep and ultra-deepwater with the postponement of the decommissioning stage, leading to increasing maintenance costs due to aging effects. This paper proposes an adaptive methodology for the development of a digital twin that performs automated numerical analysis via finite element model updating (FEMU) based on coupled systems of a high-fidelity FPSO hull model. The methodology employs a three-cargo tank length finite element (FE) model to receive data and automatically solve multiple numerical analyses. If during results checking any alert level is reached by any structural component, a more complex structural reliability method is applied to provide failure probability considering material strength statistical distribution. The application herein investigates the effects of corrosion, but other phenomena can be considered within the developed framework. A corrosion prediction model is used to create different hypotheses of degradation for bottom plates, while data provided from coupled systems are considered to investigate the effect of deterioration. The results demonstrate a consistent probability of failure when compared to the evolution of the predicted corrosion during service life.\n",

In these models, several model constants are introduced, yet they have rarely been changed from nominal values. Tuning of these constants to adapt ship flow simulations will be feasible using data assimilation technique together with available measurement data. As a very 1st step for such development, a data assimilation code using an Ensemble Kalman Filter (EnKF) is implemented and integrated to an in-house viscous flow solver for ship hydrodynamics developed at the National Maritime Research Institute. Twin experiments of parameter estimation for SA and k-omega shear stress transport (SST) turbulence models are carried out aiming to confirm fundamental functionality of the developed framework for data assimilation. A simple flow field around a two dimensional flat plate is of the interest. The assimilation results show different trends. When the SA model is adopted and 5 constants are assimilated, all the constants statistically converge to the nominal values within 80 filtering steps using 40 ensemble members. When the k-omega SST model is adopted and 1 to 4 constants are assimilated, two constants (one parameter associated with viscous diffusion term of turbulent kinetic energy, and the other parameter associated with the cross-diffusion term of specific frequency) show difficulty in statistical convergence even after 500 times of filtering with 40 ensemble members.\n",

As per the Fit for 55 package, Cold Ironing (CI) or Shore-Side Electricity (SSE), must be provided by the European ports to calling ships by 2025 (Directive 2014/EU). CI will significantly reduce the emissions produced by the auxiliary engines (AEs) of the vessels to meet the auxiliary energy needs of the vessel. Due to the intermittent nature of Renewable Energy Sources (RES), it is hardly unlikely to achieve the power needed on their own. Thus, the energy mix could include a combination of RES with a LNG burning gas turbine, due to its short start-up times and high-power density. The use of gaseous biofuels as drop-in, such as upgraded biomethane, could further decrease the environmental footprint of the overall activity. The Integrated Ship Energy Flowchart (ISEF) creates a digital twin of the energy flow of vessels and fleets for the calculation of GHG emissions and aids in the evaluation of emission mitigation options in overall fleet terms via the definition of statistically average vessels and the examination of scenarios of dual fuel engines and alternative fuels. In the present paper ISEF estimates the power and energy needs of a vessel when at berth or anchorage to inform accordingly the port authorities and/or the electricity provider before the vessel reaches the port. ISEF is monitoring the vessel via AIS following the route to the destination port and provides estimation of exhaust emissions like CO2, NOx, CO, HC (hydrocarbons), OC (organic carbon) and EC (elementary carbon) also calculating the benefit from the CI in terms of reducing GHG and hazardous emissions.\n",

      "Scalable framework for AIS data exploration through effective density visualizations\n",
      "With tens of thousands of vessels around the globe transmitting their positions daily, interpreting such large volumes of data is more than a challenging task. Through the Automatic Identification System (AIS), introduced in 2002, the coordinates and status of the vessels are continuously reported, with a transmission frequency ranging from 3 minutes down to a few seconds depending on their speed. Today, these millions of AIS messages and dozens of gigabytes of new data produced daily allow monitoring the movement of passenger or commercial vessels, as well as more complex activities like fishing and search-and-rescue operations. Studying the properties of AIS data and modeling vessel behavior has been the subject of numerous works the past few years. These attempts to describe vessel activity aim at a better understanding of their movement, often through the use of advanced mechanisms for capturing specific types of events. Although such approaches have been proven effective for a variety of scenarios, the resulting models are not easily comprehensible by the user, with notable examples being the trained neural networks or many of the classification models. Moreover, although recently there have been a few proposed works for extracting common vessel routes through historic data analysis, the end results by design do not provide the full picture regarding all movement in the area, solely including representative pathways. In order to overcome these issues, easily interpretable visualizations of movement at sea would provide a clear understanding of vessel behavior and the occurring trends. An experimental analysis that highlights the utility of vessel density maps in marine activities was presented in 2015 by Shelmerdine [1], with indicative experiments performed on a limited area around Shetland. A more scenario-specific analysis by Vespe et al. [2] focuses on visualizing the impact of piracy events over transport, while Chen et al. [3] attempted to also include the reported speed and course information from the AIS data in their maps. Furthermore, a framework for creating heat maps through a parallel Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) was proposed recently [4]. In their approach, Huang et al. present an efficient pipeline for trajectory compression and visualization in the context of Internet of Things (IoT) applications, with their solution relying on GPU-related accelerations. In this work, we extend our own MT-AIS-Toolbox [5], and present a scalable and effective tool for handling AIS datasets and visualizing vessel activity. For the purpose of creating an efficient and easily configurable solution, a state-of-the-art framework for scalable data processing, namely PySpark, is utilized. The proposed tool is able to manage large volumes of raw AIS messages and produce effective density maps for vessel movement according to the user configurations and needs. Our approach is split into two separate steps: first a dedicated mechanism is responsible for removing unnecessary or erroneous records and limiting the dataset within the spatio-temporal constraints of each use case. Then, the density of the area of interest is extracted, according to the selected metric, and ready-for-display density maps, that depict the vessel traffic, are generated. A few options for density metrics (such as number of different vessels that passed, the time spent at each area, the number of times vessels passed over an area etc.) are provided, with the user also being able to easily define a function that is best suited for their desired results. Additionally, options for comparing and combining different density maps are also included for a more complete analysis. Indicative experiments on a large real-world trajectory dataset were conducted, highlighting the performance capabilities of the proposed framework, in terms of execution time. Finally, as an application, the proposed extended tool has been utilized for data exploration and preparation during the training of machine learning models, as part of an EU-funded project for the digitalization of vessel behavior (i.e. VesselAI).\n",

      "Current monitoring strategies revolve around proactive maintenance. Corrosion-induced thickness loss (CITL) is one of the most common types of structural deterioration in ship hulls. Recently, Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) has emerged as an appealing alternative that may drive the transition to predictive maintenance. The complexity of ship structures requires that any SHM system must be designed to fully exploit information collected from a limited number of sensors. The aim of this work is to take a step in this direction by framing the design of an SHM system for CITL monitoring in hull structures under the guise of an optimization problem. The problem of detecting the existence of a certain level of thickness loss in hull structural elements is considered and treated using detection theory. The Optimal Sensor Placement (OSP) problem aims to generate strain sensor architectures that maximize the performance of the employed detector and minimize the costs incurred by its erroneous decisions. A computational implementation is considered, and synthetic strain data are generated using a detailed FE model of a reference vessel. Uncertainty is propagated to the data through a Monte Carlo Simulation (MCS). A Genetic Algorithm (GA) is employed to treat the optimization problem and the resultant sensor designs are compared to manually selected alternatives.\n",

      "From fault tree to fault graph: Bayesian network embedding-based fault isolation for complex equipment\n",
      "Fault isolation (or fault location) aims to identify the component responsible for the defective behavior's symptoms, which is a significant part of predictive maintenance. However, it is difficult to sort out which component is accountable for the fault characteristics in complex equipment, due to limited space for sensor setup and its synergetic process. Different from fault tree, this paper proposes a large-scale fault graph to locate the fault components through probability inference, which leverages domain expertise. Specifically, a fault graph (type of knowledge graph) has been established firstly using hierarchical structure and domain-specific knowledge. Following, a Multi-field hyperbolic embedding method has been applied to vectorize the node and edge, maximally preserving the logical rules within the fault graph. Next, Bayesian network has been utilized to model the causality of fault graph with the well-trained graph embedding, then reasoning the possible fault component. Lastly, a maintenance case of oil drilling equipment is carried out, where the proposed method has been contrasted with other cutting-edge models to demonstrate its effectiveness in embedding properties and inference performance. This study is expected to provide insight into the potential application of knowledge graphs for fault isolation\n",

      "This article presents the synthesis of a nonlinear multi-object differential game model in relation to the process of safe ship control in collision situations at sea. Nonlinear dynamic equations of a target ship and linear kinematic equations of passing ships were used to formulate the game state equations. The model of such a differential game was developed using LabVIEW 2022 version software. This was then subjected to simulation tests using the example of a navigational situation in which the target ship passed three encountered ships at a safe distance under the conditions of non-cooperation of ships, their cooperation, and optimal non-game control. The results of the computer simulation are presented in the form of ship trajectories and time courses of individual game control variables. The distinguishing feature of the model built in LabVIEW software is the ability to conduct research in online mode, where the user has the opportunity to track the impact of changes in the model parameters on the course of the differential game simulation on an ongoing basis. Further refinements of the simulation model should concern the larger number of ships and test the sensitivity of the game control quality to inaccuracies in the measured state variables and to changes in the parameters of the ship’s dynamics.\n",

Besides using a typical composite channel model including both small-scale fading and large-scale fading, we study a dynamic channel model which channel fluctuation is common offshore. We first introduce two unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) aided maritime communication models. By analyzing the mutual information of joint processing, we derive the closed-form expression of lower bound for the achievable rate. Simulation results indicate that joint processing can take full advantage of the channel state information contained in received data signals, and it gives rise to a satisfying spectral efficiency. Meanwhile, the joint processing shows a good performance when the ship user sails far away from the serving UAV. In addition, joint processing is not noise-limited, when the signal-to-ratio is low at sea, the joint processing can still provide a relatively high spectral efficiency.\n",

      "The transportation industry is a vital component of the global economy, responsible for the movement of goods between different locations. The intermodal freight transportation system involves the use of different modes of transportation, such as trucks, trains, and ships, to move freight containers. However, this system is loaded with inefficiencies due to the poor availability of real-time coordination and disruptions, causing delays, increased costs, and thus, higher carbon emissions. AI has the potential to improve the intermodal freight transportation system’s efficiency by optimizing operations in real-time and self-evolving the models to make better/faster decisions. While both policymaking and business operations would benefit from using real-time optimization models, the implications and applications of these models are different in each context. In policymaking, real-time optimization models are used to improve public services, reduce overall network costs, and setting regulations for sustainable management of the network. The system can consider real-time traffic conditions, weather, and other factors to optimize the routing of the trucks, reducing transportation costs, improving delivery times, maintaining resiliency, and managing emissions. This work aims to contribute with a better understanding on how these information systems can be protected from cyberthreats, while performing the optimization of freight synchromodal transportation operations in real-time in terms of efficiency, cost-effectiveness, and carbon emissions reduction, considering the dynamic nature and heterogeneity of the intermodal freight system.\n",

      "Approximately 45% of ship delivery delays are due to welding quality. To solve the problematic control of production tempo and process sequence optimization in the welding process, it is urgent to combine the characteristics of the digital twin for dynamic simulation and optimization. Therefore, the capacity evaluation and scheduling optimization for the ship welding production line (WPL) based on the digital twin is proposed. Firstly, to describe the construction method of the digital twin model and digital twin data, a strategy is proposed for the construction of a digital twin ship component WPL model. Based on the fusion mapping of model and data, the construction of the digital twin model for WPL (DTM-WPL) is achieved. Secondly, by using equipment failure rate, processing time and buffer capacity as evaluation indicators, an WPL optimization model based on digital twins is constructed to solve the WPL production sequencing problem. Thirdly, to illustrate the welding quality traceability and prediction process, a DTM-WPL synchronous mapping for quality prediction and adjustment method is proposed. Finally, taking small and medium-sized WPL as the research object, the capacity evaluation and scheduling optimization system of ship components is developed to evaluate the production capacity of ship components. The validation results indicate that the optimized process scheme has increased production efficiency by 7.27%.\n",

      "The current-carrying capacity of electric power cables has a significant effect on the total power transmitted from generation bus to the load bus. The capacity decreases as the cable temperature increases. The physics involves a positive feedback effect in which the resistance of the conductor increases as the temperature increases. Observing and predicting the thermal profile of power cables on shipboards will contribute to an efficient, reliable, and robust shipboard power system. An electro-thermal Digital Twin (DT) for predicting and observing the thermal profile of power cables is developed. The developed DT can be used to study the effect of cable temperature on power transmission. The objective of the DT will be to keep the cable temperature below its thermal rating at which deleterious effects occur. The maximum deviation between the physical and digital twin was ±0.7 °C and is well within a reasonable margin of error. Experimental results verify the capabilities of this DT which is ready for integration into larger power system digital twins.\n",

This is necessitated by the fact that currently there is no comprehensive literature review and framework for implementing Digital Twin technology in complex operations environments. Furthermore, existing interpretations of DT implementation are inadequately detailed and not very informative in this area. This may be a consequence of the difficulties of collecting and extracting useful information from data in real-time. Another drawback worth mentioning is that Digital twins at the moment center on an individual or isolated part instead of integrating the whole system and no current work talks about this holistic approach. This paper will focus on Digital Twins in complex operations environments and their applications. A review of scientific literature on the use of Digital Twins in complex operations environments is performed and the articles are categorized by the problems and challenges that they address requiring DT as a solution. A selection of papers that focus on this topic and represent the current situation of research will be emphasized. In conclusion, this work will be utilized as a baseline study to propose a Digital Twin reference framework, which eventually leads to implementing and evaluating a comprehensive Digital Twin methodology in complex systems.\n",

      "Towards improved understanding of naval ship structural performance via virtual hull monitoring\n",
      "Weight-optimised ships, such as High Speed Light Craft (HSLC), are operated by navies around the world. Naval ships must perform in harsh and contested ocean environments. Operations in high sea states result in large linear and nonlinear ship motions which in turn, induce significant loads on ship structures and accelerate structural fatigue. Monitoring and assessment of fatigue on ship structures is important for navies, to understand the performance, limitations, and life-cycle costs of their ships. An established method for monitoring structural responses is via long-term measurements, using Instrumented Hull Monitoring (IHM). However, this approach is generally too resource-intensive to be implemented on a broad scale. Virtual Hull Monitoring (VHM) is a technique to couple on-board ship data, such as Global Positioning System (GPS) data, with hindcast wave data. The resulting enriched dataset enables robust numerical fatigue analysis, because the structural responses are related to the encountered wave environment, rather than based on global wave statistics. Thus, the concept of VHM is receiving increased attention in both commercial and military sectors. This is due to its low cost and the relative ease of implementation compared to IHM. Using a Royal Australian Navy HSLC as the test bed, this study presents an investigation into the feasibility of VHM by comparing results with available IHM data. An efficient framework was developed in PythonTM to extract and couple hindcast wave data to ship speed and position, calculating the resultant stresses on the ship structure, and comparing with the measured stresses from IHM. The novel aspects of this work include the use of a semi-displacement hullform, and the utilisation of both sea-trials and long-term measurements. The study shows promising results for VHM. Finally, recommendations for further work are provided.\n",

This study proposes an edge-computing-based SHM system for operational modal analysis (OMA) of an OWT. ThssCe system comprised an open-source data acquisition (DAQ) device, a Raspberry Pi single-board computer, and associated drivers, protocols, and algorithms. The DAQ device can measure the acceleration response of an operating OWT subjected to environmental excitation and transmit raw signals to the Raspberry Pi according to the UDP protocol. The data are further processed to obtain the first-order frequency via an OMA algorithm developed by combining Kalman filtering, the random decrement technique (RDT), and the stochastic subspace identification (SSI) method. The proposed SHM system was implemented in a scaled OWT model to verify its feasibility for field use. The experimental results indicate that (1) the edge-computing-based SHM system can accurately measure the response of the OWT; (2) the proposed algorithm can estimate the modal information of the OWT during operation; (3) the variation in the first-order frequency induced by lateral loads can be identified by the SHM system. Unlike a centralized SHM system, the proposed edge-computing-based SHM system does not require massive data transmission, making it promising for offshore environments.\n",

      "A Virtual Reality Approach to the Assessment of Damage Effectiveness of Naval Artillery Ammunition Against Unmanned Surface Vessels\n",
      "Conventional evaluations of naval artillery’s destructive prowess are dependent on resource-intensive sea trials, which are neither economically viable nor advantageous for the cultivation of combat intelligence. To circumvent these limitations, we propose a method rooted in virtual reality for assessing the destructive efficacy of naval artillery ammunition against unmanned maritime targets. Leveraging the Unity3D engine, we construct a high-fidelity virtual testing environment and design corresponding testing tasks. The offensive strategy is devised considering the naval artillery’s damage radius and range, incorporating factors such as the warhead’s velocity, and determining its launch angle and direction. Following this, the projectile’s trajectory is computed employing the point mass motion equation, facilitating the simulation of the projectile’s entire life cycle trajectory. A Monte Carlo based model has been developed for assessing the damage effectiveness of naval artillery ammunition against unmanned boats. This model enables quantitative calculation of ammunition usage under varied damage probabilities, addressing issues related to the complexity of the testing process, the limited number of tests, and the challenges in computing damage probabilities for target impacts of naval artillery ammunition. The findings corroborate the precision and stability of the virtual reality based assessment method for naval artillery ammunition damage effectiveness against unmanned surface vessels in combat simulations. This verification holds substantial importance for enhancing the computation accuracy of damage effectiveness associated with naval artillery ammunition.\n",

This review investigates the progress of research on two type of uncertainty modelling methods, stochastic finite element and nonparametric modelling, in the dynamic alignment of shafting. First, the development of the alignment of ship propulsion shaft systems is outlined, and the calculation methods are summarised according to different alignment principles in two directions: static and dynamic. Second, the uncertainties affecting the ship propulsion shafting are distinguished, and the corresponding modelling methods are applied. i.e., stochastic finite element methods for data uncertainty and nonparametric modelling methods for nonparametric uncertainty. Both the methods are discussed detailedly, including the basic principles, constraints, advantages, and limitations. Then, propulsion shafting dynamic characteristics, such as bearing loads, bending moments, and bending angles, are described under various uncertainties. Additionally, the root mean square value of vibration at the bearing seat and the spectral and natural characteristics will be analysed to determine the uncertainty of the shafting.

Existing methods rely on historical traffic accident data and are not suitable for expanding cities. Against this background, we propose a framework to infer urban traffic accident hotspots by vehicle trajectory data and heterogeneous data. Firstly, we extract parking events from vehicle trajectories leveraging a map matching algorithm and obtain the parking hotspots under different weather and time periods by semantic segmentation and clustering. Secondly, we extract three sets of contextual features of parking hotspots, i.e., road names, POIs, and traffic flow. Finally, leveraging a graphical convolutional network, we build a model to infer whether a parking hotspot is a traffic accident hotspot based on contextual features. We evaluate our model leveraging real datasets in Xiamen. Results prove that our model accurately infers traffic accident hotspots in Xiamen with F1-Score of 0.794.\n",

      "Advanced ship predictors can generally be considered as a vital part of the decision-making process of autonomous ships in the future, where the information on vessel maneuvering behavior can be used as the source of information to estimate current vessel motions and predict future behavior precisely. As a result, the navigation safety of autonomous vessels can be improved. In this paper, vessel maneuvering behavior consists of continuous-time system states of two kinematic motion models—the Curvilinear Motion Model (CMM) and Constant Turn Rate & Acceleration (CTRA) Model. Two state estimation algorithms—the Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) and Unscented Kalman Filter (UKF) are implemented on these two models with certain modifications so that they can be compatible with discrete-time measurements. Four scenarios, created by combining different models and algorithms, are implemented using simulated ship maneuvering data from a bridge simulator. These scenarios are then verified through the proposed stability and consistency tests. The simulation results show that the EKF tends to be unstable combined with the CMM. The estimates from the other three scenarios can generally be considered more stable and consistent, unless sudden actions or variations in vessel heading occurred during the simulation. The CTRA is also proven to be more robust compared to the CMM. As a result, a suitable combination of mathematical models and estimation filters can be considered to support advanced ship predictors in future ship navigation.\n",

      "Companies employing an Engineer-to-Order (ETO) manufacturing strategy often develop, design and produce complex goods in single or small batches based on an individual customer order. The increased complexity caused by project business multiplies the engineering, cost, and change management efforts that are often required, resulting in lost productivity and more non-value-adding activities. To improve efficiency and reduce losses, ETO organizations strive to implement Lean practices and Industry 4.0 (I4.0) technologies, but the relevant literature in ETO industrial context is more exploratory and contains less empirical data. Building on the preliminary work categorizing the common losses in ETO organizations, the study examined how these can be reduced by Lean and I4.0 practices. Current literature was analyzed, and empirical data was collected using a survey questionnaire and semi-structured interviews with 16 companies from the construction, shipbuilding, and machinery and plant manufacturing industries. The scientific literature was compared with the empirical data to find out whether Lean methods and I4.0 technologies are known in research but not applied in practice and vice versa. As a result, there are several practices from both domains applied in practice to reduce losses, but the analyzed literature indicates few successful implementations. Future research should aim to provide more empirical data on the application of Lean and I4.0 practices to mitigate losses in companies with an ETO strategy and provide best practices and guidelines.\n",

      "Freight fleet management (FM) can be defined as an optimization process of freight vehicles scheduling and routing, aimed at reducing time, costs, energy, and environmental impacts. In the specialized literature, there are many FM studies. The focus of this paper is on the FM in the context of a container port to increase the productivity and pursue the sustainability of the logistics node improving the performance by using freight advanced handling units (HUs). The use of automated HUs reduces the time and costs of each port activity, eliminating timewasters and increasing safety; however, it requires advanced intelligent management. Moreover, the automation is in line with energy and environmental sustainability. The paper aims to assess the impacts due to the automation of HUs by using a simulation approach. After a framework of traditional and automated HUs, allowing to highlight their main characteristics, the work considers the organizational problems of a container port and introduces a methodological approach to manage the FM of HUs. Finally, the application to a real context is presented to compare the present configuration of a container port with some project scenarios, considering different levels of automation, as the partial and total replacements of traditional HUs with advanced/automated vehicles.\n",

      "We explore, for the first time in the literature, how the revenues of ship management companies respond to macroeconomic exogenous shocks. Using data for ship-management companies in Cyprus, we find evidence that a demand shock has the largest impact on revenues, exhibiting an almost one-for-one relationship. If the demand shock is permanent, we observe a ceteris paribus permanent effect on revenues. Similarly, this occurs irrespective of the final effect that demand has on the relevant freight rate, proxied via the Baltic dry and tanker (dirty and clean) indices. The BDI and the BDTI indices have a smaller effect on revenues, standing at approximately 0.05% for every 1% shock, while the clean tanker index does not have an effect, most likely due to their fleet composition. In accordance with the literature, we find that a shock in the price of Brent oil increases revenues. Our results bear importance not only for ship management companies per se, but also for countries that are ship management hubs.\n",

      "The U.S. Navy is considering medium voltage DC (MVDC) power systems as opposed to traditional AC power systems in order to accommodate modern shipboard systems: high power sensors, electronic warfare, and weapons systems. A digital twin of an MVDC naval power system is useful so that its operation can be better understood. In this work, a scaled-down demonstration model of a modern MVDC naval power system is studied through a series of experiments showing the operational benefits of the system when implemented with digital twin technologies. Two portable hybrid unified models of the scaled demonstration system were developed with incorporated machine learning techniques to show improved autonomous control. Because the unified models are portable, they may be developed in one tool, but then used with another tool on another platform. In a field setting, for example, a unified model may be simulated alongside an actual Navy ship to better understand its operation and vice versa.\n",

      "Hellinger Metrics for Validating High Fidelity Simulators Using Target Tracking\n",
      "To achieve autonomy at sea, it is believed simulations will be essential in testing, analysing and verifying autonomous systems due to the scarcity and high cost of obtaining real data for all relevant scenarios. This reliance on simulation raises the question on how much synthetic data can be trusted, especially from sensor data such as lidars, radars and cameras. Methods for validating specific sensor models exists, however these are often focusing on perceptional differences without considering the sensors impact on the autonomy’s situational awareness. In this paper we make an attempt to analyse this using a JIPDA target tracker, by comparing its performance on real and synthetic lidar data with various Hellinger metrics for Bernoulli and multi-Bernoulli multi-target densities. Our work showcases a method that quantifies sensor fidelity of synthetic data based on tracker performance, a step towards building trust to simulators targeted at validating autonomy systems.\n",

      "Adapting to the Impacts Posed by Climate Change: Applying the Climate Change Risk Indicator (CCRI) Framework in a Multi-Modal Transport System\n",
      "Climate change has threatened the infrastructure, operation, policymaking, and other pivotal aspects of transport systems with the accelerating pace of extreme weather events. While a considerable amount of research and best practices have been conducted for transport adaptation to climate change impacts, there is still a wide gap in the systematic assessment of climate risks on all-round transport modes (i.e., road, rail, sea, and air) with a comprehensive review and a quantitative scientific framework. This study aimed to critically review studies on how the transport sector has adapted to the impacts posed by climate change since the dawn of the 21st century. To support climate risk assessment in comprehensive transport systems, we developed a Climate Change Risk Indicator (CCRI) framework and applied it to the case of the British transport network. Focusing on a multi-modal transport system, this offers researchers and practitioners an invaluable overview of climate adaptation research with the latest tendency and empirical insights. Meanwhile, the developed CCRI framework elaborates a referable tool that enables decision-makers to employ objective data to realise quantitative risk analysis for rational transport adaptation planning.\n",

      "Strategies for Green Shipbuilding Design and Production Practices Focused on Reducing Microplastic Pollution Generated during Installation of Plastic Pipes\n",
      "In recent years, microplastic pollution has been given increasing attention in marine environments due to the hazard it poses for aquatic organisms. Plastic pipes are now being widely used in shipbuilding, and due to easy processing, they are often installed directly on ships. This includes the cutting and preparation of pipes for welding, which produces plastic debris in the immediate vicinity of the marine environment. Such plastic debris can easily become airborne, and when it is ultimately deposited into the water, it can be a contributor to marine microplastic pollution. This could be reduced if, during the design stage and outfitting stage, engineers would take into consideration ecological aspect of their design, which is currently not the case. Therefore, in this paper, suggestions for green shipbuilding practices, focused on the piping design and production phases, are presented for the possible reduction in operations with plastic pipes, with the main aim of reducing microplastic pollution. Based on these recommendations, additional economic and feasibility investigations are needed to obtain optimal results, which would be beneficial both from a manufacturing and ecological perspective.\n",

      "Visibility Performance Assessment: Simulation of a Digital Shadow in a Port\n",
      "The growth of goods transported by ship affects the entire maritime industry, which is central to the global supply chain. Faced with an increased pressure from the industry, ports need greater visibility on the flow of goods and logistics operations. To tackle this challenge, improvement opportunities as well as weaknesses must be identified in order to define an efficient data acquisition strategy that will allow port authorities to enhance their current visibility within their port ecosystem. This article presents the simulation of a digital shadow based on a Canadian port case study. The study uses the simulation of a digital shadow to diagnose a Canadian port authority’s current visibility, with an accent on data accuracy, in order to identify improvement opportunities aimed at overcoming weaknesses identified in a current practice scenario and then compare the performance of the current system with said improvements in a second scenario. To our knowledge, this is the first simulation study on visibility performance assessment in a port’s digital shadow.\n",

      "Fuzzy Evaluation of Inland Ship Lock Service Condition Based on Combination Weighting and Matter-Element Extension Cloud Model\n",
      "Ship lock as a typical hydraulic structure has become an important node in waterway transportation. Due to the long operating life and high demand of throughput, many locks are under the overloaded operation situation. However, the service condition assessment of ship locks has rarely been directly studied, and there is a lack of an efficient and standardized method owing to the complex structure of the ship lock system. In this paper, a multi-level hierarchical system including 36 indexes was constructed based on the engineering breakdown structure theory. The synthetic weights of indexes were determined by the order relation method and entropy weight method combining subjectivity and objectivity. The extension cloud model combining the extension theory and cloud model was put forward, aiming to deal with the uncertainty of fuzziness and randomness in the evaluation process. Then, two typical locks were investigated, and the numerical scores indicated that their states belong to Level III and Level IV, respectively. The proposed method reveals the structural condition and provides theoretical reference for the maintenance of ship locks, which can be applied with generalizability and operability.\n",

      "Incentive Oriented Two-Tier Task Offloading Scheme in Marine Edge Computing Networks: A Hybrid Stackelberg-Auction Game Approach\n",
      "With the increasing exploration of marine resources, various marine wireless devices have been rapidly deployed for different marine applications such as marine navigation, ocean environment monitoring, and seabed resource exploitation. However, due to long transmission delay and low data rate between marine wireless devices and the cloud, it is challenging to satisfy the service requirements of computing-intensive and delay-sensitive tasks. By migrating computing resources from cloud to the near side of ocean, the paradigm of marine edge computing networks, which integrates communication and computation capacities in marine wireless devices, is expected to support a variety of marine tasks (e.g., data collection, monitoring and processing) with low delay and high data rate. However, considering the rationality and selfishness of marine wireless devices and their limited computing-capacity, how to motivate marine wireless devices to conduct task processing becomes an important problem for improving computing efficiency. To address this issue, in this paper, we propose an incentive oriented two-tier task offloading scheme for marine edge computing networks via hybrid Stackelberg-auction game approach, with the objective of improving the offloading efficiency and maximizing marine wireless devices’ utilities. Specifically, for underwater acoustic transmission tier, we exploit multi-access task offloading scheme, in which underwater wireless sensor (UWS) uploads its workloads to an unmanned underwater vehicle (UUV) and a sea surface sink node (SN) via non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) transmission. We formulate the utility of each party and model the task offloading process among UWS, UUV and SN as a Stackelberg game to optimize the UWS’s offloading strategy, UUV’s and SN’s price strategies. For radio frequency transmission tier, SN can offload its partial workloads to an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) via frequency division multiple access (FDMA) transmission. We provide their utilities and model the offloading process between a SN and a UAV as a double auction game to optimize their bidding strategies. Extensive simulation results are provided to validate the performance of the proposed scheme. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed algorithms can obtain the optimal solutions and increase the utilities for marine wireless devices.\n",

      "To train inexperienced workers for the construction, production, and maintenance of subsea production systems, a virtual reality simulation platform was developed. The entire framework, software, and hardware platforms of the system were designed and introduced. A multi-person collaborative simulation was achieved based on the high-level architecture protocol. The real-time dynamic calculation software Vortex was used to add physical properties to each geometrical model and set collision detections and motion constraints so that the VR system can reflect the real motion response of the structures in real-time during virtual simulation. Visual simulation software Vega Prime and Vortex were integrated to realise the real-time rendering and drawing of virtual ocean engineering scenes. Thus, a virtual simulation system with large-scale complex scenes based on real-time dynamic calculation and multi-person collaborative operation was established. A typical ocean engineering case of subsea manifold installation was simulated using the virtual simulation system, and the detailed simulation flow was explained. A multibody dynamics system of the ship-cable-subsea manifold was established using Orcaflex to obtain the accurate motion response of the subsea manifold during lowering. In the virtual simulation process, the obtained hydrodynamic calculation results can provide an important guideline and reference to the operators. The developed simulation system is a suitable tool for training ocean engineering workers and realistically simulating ocean operation cases.\n",

      "Domain-adapted feature transfer: A generalized framework for short-term vessel speed prediction\n",
      "Data-driven methods have been in sight in ocean engineering for short-term vessel speed prediction. However, due to the requirements of large amounts of training data and the inevitable distributed inconsistency among datasets, they are not easy to generalize or achieve superior performance. Specifically, inadequate recorded data of newly in-serviced vessels and ever-changing met-ocean climates making it hard to fulfill an accurate prediction in practice, and it is tough to be improved by merely raising new data-driven models. Taking the case study of Valemax vessels, we uncover that the input–output features have significant differences between datasets, which impair the effectiveness of data-driven models in practical use. With the purpose of designing domain-invariant features for data-driven models, we propose a domain-adapted feature transfer (DAFT), a generalized strategy to narrow the differences of distribution between datasets, which can be combined with a variety of models to form a framework for short-term vessel speed prediction. The superiority and generalization of DAFT are demonstrated through detailed experiments with quantitative and qualitative analyses. In addition, its robustness when faced with insufficient data and the feasibility of using data from sister-ships are also clearly verified. Code is available at https://github.com/Ldiper/DAFT.\n",

      "Ship maneuvering model optimization for improved identification with less excitation\n",
      "The precise model of a ship is the foundation for its operation and control. The traditional methods of building such models are time-consuming and require large amounts of simulation data, sea trial experiments, or calculating with professional computational fluid dynamics software. Usually, specific maneuvers are conducted to obtain the experimental data with full excitation. In this paper, we propose a ship maneuvering model optimization method that can lower the requirement on data excitation during model identification by simplification. First, the least squares method is used to identify the preliminary parameters of the ship mathematical model. Then, correlation analysis can determine the correlation among the parameters and divide the parameters with higher correlation into one group. Sensitivity analysis is used to detect the influence level of parameters and as a basis for selecting the more critical parameters. Based on the results of these two analyses, we set up a standard to simplify the ship maneuvering mathematical model. Finally, the simplified model and the complete model are tested under different levels of data excitation, and the experiment results verify that the simplified model can perform better than the complete model when identifying with less excitation data.\n",

      "The current aquaculture environment anomaly monitoring system is limited in function, making it difficult to provide overall technical support for the sustainable development of aquaculture ecosystems. This paper designs a set for an IoT-based aquaculture environment monitoring device. The device is capable of collecting five aquaculture environment factors such as water temperature, pH, salinity, dissolved oxygen and light intensity throughout the day by wireless data transmission via 4G DTU with a communication success rate of 92.08%. A detection method based on time series sliding window density clustering (STW-DBSCAN) is proposed for anomaly detection, using the confidence interval distance radius of slope to extract subsequence timing features and identify the suspected abnormal subsequences and then further determine the anomalous value by the DBSCAN clustering method. The detection results show that the algorithm can accurately identify abnormal subsequences and outliers, and the accuracy, recall and F1-Score are 87.71%, 82.58% and 85.06%, respectively, which verifies the usability of the proposed method. Further, a fuzzy control algorithm is adopted to specify the warning information, and a software platform is developed based on data visualization. The platform uses WebSocket technology to interact with the server, and combined with the surveillance camera, it can monitor the aquaculture environment and perform data monitoring and analysis in a real-time, accurate and comprehensive manner, which can provide theoretical reference and technical support for sustainable development of aquaculture.\n",

The combination of high frequency data and the employment of advanced analytical technologies offers the shipping industry a great advantage. Continuous data monitoring enables reactive energy performance improvement / optimization, while it allows building up realistic performance models that are used for optimizing the commercial management of the vessels and serve as a basis for new projects.

      "Estimation of wind, waves and fouling effect on ships from full scale and hindcast data\n",
      "Assessment of vessel performance requires estimating various types of added resistance to the calm water resistance, with the most significant caused by the presence of wind, waves and fouling of the hull and propeller. In this paper, the performance prediction system VESPER is applied to the estimation of added resistance for two fleets, one of bulkers and one of containerships. Firstly, the bias and error of measurements from ship-mounted anemometers is investigated. The measured wind speeds were corrected for the anemometer height and compared with hindcast data. Two different pairs of anemometer heights and wind shear exponents were used and the Mean Bias Percentage Error (MBPE) between the anemometer and hindcast data was evaluated. The study showed an overestimation of wind speed from the anemometers due to flow acceleration by the presence of the superstructure and the ship itself. The acceleration was higher for containerships compared to bulkers. Also, for both fleets the acceleration was higher for side winds. Additionally, the change of the average Confidence Interval of the calculated total added resistance is presented after applying corrections for wind, waves and currents, using both the above wind data sets with and without corrections. For both fleets, the effect of fouling was calculated significantly higher compared to the effect of the weather. Finally, the SPAWAVE method was applied to quantify the effect of waves, which, relative to the total added resistance, was calculated stronger for the bulkers compared to the containerships, while the effect of the wind was similar between the two ship types.\n",

      "First principle Digital Twins (DT) for marine engines are widely used to estimate in-cylinder pressure, which is a key parameter informing health of ship power plants. However, development and application of DT faces barriers, as they require exhaustive calibration and high computational power, which render their implementation for shipboard systems challenging. This study aims at developing a data-driven DT of low computational cost for predicting instantaneous pressure. Two different approaches using Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) with distinct input parameters are assessed. The first predicts in-cylinder pressure as a function of the phase angle, whereas the second predicts the discrete Fourier coefficients (FC) corresponding to the in-cylinder pressure variations. The case study of a conventional medium speed four-stroke diesel marine engine is employed, for which the first principle DT based on a thermodynamic, zero dimensional approach was setup and calibrated against shop trials measurements. The DT is subsequently employed to generate data for training and validating developed ANNs. The derived results demonstrate that the second approach exhibits mean square errors within ±2% and requires the lowest computations cost, rendering it appropriate for marine engines DTs. Sensitivity analysis results verify the amount of training data and number of Fourier coefficients required to achieve adequate accuracy.\n",

      "Oil detection technology improves the reliability of machinery or equipment. The physical and chemical indicators of the fluid can reflect the cause of the failure in various aspects, which can prevent major accidents to the greatest extent by setting up a fault tree. Owing to the lack of data, it is difficult to accurately obtain the basic event probabilities, which makes it difficult to diagnose faults. The expert evaluation method and aggregated fuzzy numbers are used to exact the failure probability, where the event probability is evaluated as the subjective will of the expert. To improve the probabilistic accuracy, weights are improved by the combined assignment method as well as the reasonableness analysis. A fault tree diagnostic model is constructed for qualitative and quantitative analysis, taking the ship engine oil viscosity high fault as an example. According to the results, the model can provide a comprehensive analysis of physical and chemical indicators. Experts’ own weights have a large impact on the failure probability, with their weight changes leading to a change in the failure ranking. From the discrimination, following a Bland–Altman analysis of the results, the selected combined empowerment method improved the discrimination of the results by 4.8% compared to the traditional method, with 100% data consistency, which proved that the improvement was reliable and effective. The structure of this fault diagnosis model is clear, which can quickly give the fault cause and probability reference value.\n",

      "Since the introduction of scientific disciplines into the shipbuilding process, there has been a search for optimisation of human and material resources. The current environmental crisis is putting additional pressure on global resource management and special attention to materials sourcing and utilisation. This paper discusses the potential solution for the current lack of effectiveness at early design stages, which are still based on 2D drawings. The industry is demanding a new 3D approach, which implies, first, a change in the procedures, and second, having a suitable CAD/CAM tool for the early generation of a digital mock-up, from which the project is developed throughout all design and production phases, from conceptual design to operation. The proposed solution shown in this paper would improve the general arrangement definition, with the use of CAD for the 3D definition of the compartments and the main equipment positioning; improve the naval architecture calculation; and finally improve the basic/class design stage, with better reuse of data already developed in the general arrangement model and in the definition of a 3D model of structure, with the main equipment positioning, pipes, and electrical equipment already into the model. Intelligent P&I diagrams and single-wire electric diagrams would be used at this stage and connected to the 3D model. Additionally, it will allow for early estimating of materials, weights, and associated processes. This will be further supported by the use of topology to consider design alternatives and produce early information on materials for procurement and production. The cost reduction associated with the definition of the early design stages in 3D has been estimated at around 15% of the overall design and production stages.\n",

Many of these artificial intelligence tools and approaches, including machine learning algorithms, have the potential to support four major undersea system life cycle stages: conceptualization, development, utilization (operation), and support (maintenance). This paper provides basic background information about autonomy, artificial intelligence, the system life cycle, and modern undersea systems of interest. Representative examples are used to define current and potential use-cases for artificial intelligence within each specific life cycle stage.

      "An anti-swaying or swaying-reduction effect for a container crane is key for improving the rapidity and safety of container handling operations. By analyzing the structure of a container crane hydraulic anti-swaying system, a dynamic system model was developed in the time domain, and the changing law of the load swaying angle was studied. In order to study the attenuation effect of the load swaying angle and the different working states of the anti-swaying system, the frequency domain equation of the load swaying angle was developed in the frequency domain. A time domain study on the dynamic model shows that the structure parameter is the key parameter that affects the load anti-swaying effect, and a larger structure parameter produces a better anti-swaying effect. A study regarding the load swaying angle in the frequency domain shows that the container crane hydraulic anti-swaying system works in a critical-damping state when the structure parameter load ratio is equal to twice the system frequency, and in this case, the hydraulic anti-swaying system has good load swaying-reduction effect and a small dependence on changes in the hoisting rope length. The longitudinal and transverse installation distances of the anti-swaying fixed pulleys jointly affect the structure parameter. In engineering applications, the longitudinal and transverse distances can be selected according to size near that of a standard container. To obtain a good swaying-reduction effect, data such as the hoisting load mass, the hoisting rope length, and the hoisting load swaying speed can be obtained in real-time and used to calculate the required pressure adjustments for the relief valve of the hydraulic anti-swaying system.\n",

      "Improvement of JENSEN model for the compressor volume flow rate of marine diesel engine\n",
      "Modeling is an efficient and validated method in industry digitalization, and it lays a foundation for smart applications like digital twins, fault diagnostics, control system design, and performance optimization. Methods of modeling play a key role. As years passed, JENSEN model has been widely used in turbocharged diesel engines for calculating the mass flow rate of centrifugal compressor of turbocharger. However, it is difficult to get good accuracy and a good convergence performance at the same time. For the first time, we propose a model, called M-JENSEN, which has been validated to be of good accuracy and well convergence performance at the same time. The optimal objective of Jensen’s model is the dimensionless pressure head, while the volume flow rate is what the user wants in practice. This difference makes the accuracy loss in Jensen’s model. An attempt has been made to change the optimal objective; the accuracy was improved but convergence was hard to reach. Thus, a modified version of Jensen’s model, M-JENSEN, was proposed by swapping the position of Mach number and dimensionless pressure head. Compared to Jensen’s model, the accuracy of M-JENSEN model was improved by 29.5% measured by R-square and 52.3% measured by RMSE in ABB A270. Its performance was also validated in MAN TCA88 and showed consistent results.\n",

      "The paper describes the conceptual design of the project: “Development of zero-emission passenger sailing ship”, as the breakthrough approach to use renewable energy sources (RES) for ship propulsion and other on-board operations. The project is co-financed by the European Union from the European Regional Development Operational Program “Competitiveness and Cohesion 2014–2020” and fully in line with the ongoing Horizon Europe Framework Programme for Green Maritime Transport. The electricity for the electric ship propulsion is stored in rechargeable batteries. The important research challenge is the recharging of batteries, applying the hybrid process of converting wind and solar energy using different technological solutions: propellers operating in the turbine mode as drive motors operate in generator mode, auxiliary hydrokinetic turbines, wind turbines, photovoltaic system, and connection to coastal power sources. These hybrid energy conversion options are promising, as they provide energy for the ship’s electrical propulsion motors and power all other on-board equipment. The project consortium is entirely Croatian consisting of shipbuilding industry members and academic partners, adopting a very “shipbuilding approach” by reusing the results from the already built sailing ship Klara, as a reference design with ICE drives, to design and build the new sailing ship LeDA with zero-emission propulsion. LeDA will be the full-scale prototype of a 3-masted cruising sailing ship for a maximum of 36 passengers, to be built in the Croatian shipyard Brodosplit, and expected to empower the Croatian shipbuilding industry with such new products and their commercialization for the world waterborne transportation market.\n",

      "With the development of ship intelligence, the frequency of upgrading the marine engine room simulator, which is essential for crew training, has increased. Traditionally, the data processing unit (DPU) of the marine engine room simulator is upgraded by manually downloading the firmware. This makes the hardware maintenance high-cost. In this paper, we first propose a WAN-based firmware upgrade system to enable secure over-the-air upgrades of DPUs and reduce operation and maintenance costs. A distributed hardware structure is given to manage DPU in the simulator via the Internet. We have designed two methods of firmware upgrades, automatic upgrades and remote upgrades. In automatic upgrades, the DPU can download new firmware upgrades from the web server through the router. By designing a series of mechanisms including code rollback, code backup and code confirmation, the In-Application Programming (IAP) technique is realized through the Internet. Firmware upgrades have good fault tolerance mechanisms to ensure that the emulator can still work in the event of an upgrade error. In remote upgrades, we upgrade the DPU firmware through the remote control center. We assessed the performance of the system by measuring the success rate of DPU upgrades, upgrade time and performance after the upgrade. The results show that the DPU upgrade success rate is close to 100% and performance is as good as expected. The results show that the remote firmware upgrade system proposed in this paper is reliable and practical.\n",

      "As the marine industry looks to develop and integrate autonomous vessels and platforms into the global fleet, new design challenges emerge as the complexity of the vessel design process increases in parallel with the growing need for larger and more diversified multi-disciplinary design teams. The design of autonomous vessels presents the need for novel marine designs with the use of diverse skill sets, knowledge sets, and technical backgrounds from the early stages of the design process. In developing novel marine designs, explicit, implicit, and tacit knowledge is needed for the development of successful concepts. Given the novelty and complexity of autonomous vessels, a significant amount of conditional, path dependent tacit knowledge is required in the design process. To form successful designs and to form a foundation for future development of autonomous vessels, it is critical that methods and frameworks be developed to represent, share, and codify necessary tacit knowledge and its interdependencies within system design in explicit form ahead of full product development.\n",

      "In modern information warfare, medium and long-range weapons with high strike precision are often used to ensure stable, accurate, and ruthless conditions. However, the target system often has multiple target units and which target units to specifically attack becomes the primary issue. This study constructs a target combat system network based on the complex network theory and maximum entropy principle, establishes a key target selection model based on this network, and then determines the use of medium and long-range weapons to strike the key target unit in the enemy combat system network. The key target selection model consists of four parts. The first is a value model of the node itself constructed by comprehensively considering the relationship between the target and the war, the importance of the target in the system, and the threat of the target. The second is a node network value model based on the potential field theory. The third is to construct a cascading failure model of the target system through the definition of triples (results of strike action, target unit status, and failure influence relationship between target units). Fourth, with the optimal cost-effectiveness ratio as the objective function, the evaluation criterion function model is established. Case scenarios and simulation experiments illustrate the rationality and effectiveness of the method which can provide effective solutions for commanders to select key targets.\n",

      "Large, complex structures in the maritime sector are often engineered and built to order. Due to the complexity and enormous number of installed components, assemblies and outfitting parts, there is often an abandonment of the complete design of all elements. Especially smaller components such as cables, which complete the product in the outfit, are typical examples. This state of affairs leads to a deficient data situation. Against this background, the coordination and traceability of the installation processes is severely limited. Furthermore, completeness checks and the derivation of essential key figures involve a great deal of downstream effort and are in part not possible. The paper therefore takes up this specific problem and discusses possible solutions. Approaches, which enable an increase in transparency despite the lack of data, minimize these negative effects. Based on the use of Auto-ID, a tracking of the installed components takes place. The feedback of the collected data permits the generation of key figures. Furthermore, the comprehensible process design serves the superordinate coordination of peripheral processes and allows the derivation of necessary action measures. Above all, the expansion of communication between direct and indirect areas during installation is a focus and optimization compared to the status. Based on this, a consistent data stream is the prerequisite for this approach\n",

      "Virtual port modeling method based on dynamic fluid field data\n",
      "To achieve the digital upgradation of ports, a virtual port modeling method based on the dynamic flow field data was proposed. The geometric feature of a port was reconstructed by the three-dimensional（3 D） reconstruction model with the aerial image data of unmanned aerial vehicle（UAV） oblique photography, and a high-precision 3 D model was established. The simplified model of the edge collapse algorithm based on the quadric error metric was introduced to prevent low rendering efficiency caused by the data overflow. The high time consuming step in the numerical calculation of Euler method was analyzed. A neural network model was built to learn the evolution feature of the flow field. The calculation of the projection term was accelerated to produce the dynamic flow field data that were used to drive the dynamic rendering of water flow. The smoothed particle hydrodynamics（SPH） method was employed to reflect the interactions of water flow with ships and land. In this way, not only was the real-time performance of rendering ensured, but also the realistic effect of rendering was improved. Research results show that the 3 D reconstruction model of the reconstructed port has 3 320 937 vertices, and the rendering frequency of the reconstructed grid model is 78.7 Hz in Meshlab. After almost 90.0% of the vertices are removed from the model via model simplification, the number of vertices reduces to 332 836, and the rendering frequency enhances to 108.7 Hz. The geometric errors of the model are smaller than 2.0% after simplification. In a 256×256 flow field grid, the average update interval is roughly 17 ms for the water flow velocity field obtained by the grid fluid calculation method accelerated by a neural network, and the average simulation precision is 88.6%. When the flow field data and 3 D port model were driven by an open scene graph（OSG） engine, the average rendering frequency can reach 50.5 Hz. In conclusion, the proposed method can effectively solve the key problems in high-precision real-time rendering to achieve the dynamic balance between simulation precision and rendering efficiency. It enables high-precision virtual port modeling and real-time dynamic simulation without great precision loss. 1 tab, 11 figs, 30 refs.\n",

A spatial model of a rotary table with a gap compensation mechanism as sliding supports in the integrated CAD KOMPAS-3D environment has been developed. A design scheme is proposed, and the efforts required to create a guaranteed hard contact are determined. The effectiveness of the proposed method for compensating the gap due to the worm displacement relative to the wheel is substantiated. The phenomena associated with a decrease in the intensity of wear and arising in the engagement of a worm gear with limitations on rigidity are investigated. A mathematical model of a two-parameter problem of optimizing the wear rate using Lagrange multipliers is formed. The concept of increasing the resource of a mechanical transmission due to the availability of gapless contact between the worm and the wheel is analyzed. The authors conclude that using sliding supports will reduce the time for adjusting machine tools and make the process of manufacturing housing parts more economical. An analytical apparatus for determining the main parameter of the worm gear by the minimum wear criterion is created. The assumption about the rational area of using this design of the backlash-free transmission for the rotary table at low gear ratios and the use of quadric-thread worms is substantiated.\n",

The digital twin traffic environment was constructed by classifying and modeling objects. An automatic navigation model was developed by combination of course control method, ship maneuvering motion and sailing resuming model, and ship’s nonlinear maneuvering motion was deduced. The requirements of International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea 1972 were quantitatively analyzed based on the automatic navigation model, and the dynamic collision avoidance mechanism was studied. The method to calculate applicable course was established. In the multi-target environment, the maneuvering discrimination method of target ship was proposed. The method to obtain the factors such as the course changing time, amplitude and sailing resuming time which constitute the autonomous navigation scheme under the constraint of rules was studied. Simulation results show that the intelligent navigation method can adapt to the residual error and random motion of the target ships based on the rolling calculations of the information update at the second-level. The proposed intelligent navigation method can accurately achieve the feasible course range and course change amplitude of 1°. The calculation step lengths of program and sailing resumption time are set to 1 and 10 s, respectively, and multiple static objects and six target ships maintaining the course and speed are established in this simulation environment. Own ship remains clear from all targets and sails autonomously to the destination after a series of maneuverings of 9° to starboard, sailing resuming, keeping course and speed, sailing resuming at 640, 1 053, 2 561 and 3 489 s, respectively. Target ships are set to perform uncoordinated collision avoidance actions at 300 s, and own ship remains clear from all targets and sails autonomously to the destination after a series of maneuverings of 9° to starboard, 12° to port, 17° to starboard, and sailing resuming at 980, 2 790, 3 622 and 5 470 s, respectively. Therefore, a ship in any initial states can automatically sail along a planned route to its destination.

      "Handling complexity in conceptual ship design processes requires a thorough understanding of complexity aspects in general. More than 100 scientific papers on the subject published since 1962 are, therefore, reviewed and discussed in this paper. The paper expands the understanding of complexity theory by reviewing the literature in the engineering domain. Different definitions of complexity, characteristics of complex systems, aspects of complexity in design, complexity sources, and its drivers are explored and discussed in detail. Furthermore, the findings are arranged into relevant complexity factors in ship design. Related complexity factors in ship design, are also discussed by use of examples from everyday ship design practices. This study is a theoretical elaboration to shed light on the current practice and future research direction in handling complexity in conceptual ship design processes to improve competitiveness.\n",

      "Development of a simulation environment for hybrid propulsion drive trains: Utilization of a holistic approach to predict the dynamic behavior in the early design stage\n",
      "This paper covers the generic procedure for the creation and usage of a complete system simulation for propulsion systems of ships with focus on complex hybrid systems. Due to the large number of available components and challenging operational profiles, there is no longer a single best solution, especially in specialized shipbuilding. On top of that even minor changes in the propulsion system can have a substantial impact on plant performance and vessel behavior. Thus, the early design stage is crucial. The design procedure usually incorporates the selection and dimensioning of available components and concepts. Once this has been done, the dynamic behavior can be analyzed using the developed system simulation environment. With the knowledge gained the needed alterations in the concept can be identified and implemented in the subsequent design iteration circle. Based on the example of an offshore anchor handling vessel, the integration potential of a hybrid propulsion system is examined and evaluated according to the aforementioned procedure. The applied tool is a system simulation environment developed in the Department of Marine Engineering, consisting of a distributed co-simulation of the existing ship design environment E4 and Matlab® Simulink®.\n",
