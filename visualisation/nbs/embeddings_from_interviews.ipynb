       "<p><b>Daniel Reed:</b> And with advancements in machine learning and AI, these digital twins will only become smarter. We’re looking at a future where these virtual models can autonomously optimize ship designs or operational strategies based on continually gathered data, effectively becoming an indispensable part of maritime engineering. <small>[<a class=\"tooltip\" onclick=\"showPreview('Data Driven Digital Twins for the Maritime Domain', 'Digital twins are computational models that replicate the structure, behaviour and overall characteristics of a physical asset in the digital world. In the maritime domain, conventional approaches have relied on mathematical modeling (e.g., linearised equations of motion) and heavy computations for estimating ship resistance and propulsion, seakeeping and maneuverability and overall hull form optimization, treating the vessel as a point body. For instance, the ability to predict a vessel’s future track in confined or congested waters presents a significant challenge due to the fact that as time passes, these models often fall out of sync with their digital counterparts due to changes that happen to the ship (e.g., foulding affecting maneuverability). In addition to this, mostly due to computational resources required, in real world deployments models are simplified, thus reducing their overall prediction accuracy. In our work, we implement AI-enabled coupled abstractions of the asset-twin system, which rely on machine learning methods for constant learning of the evolving over time behavior of a vessel based on historical trip data and information related to vessel’s structure and loading capacity. The evaluation results indicate that the inclusion of vessel and journey specific information is beneficial for the predictions.', 'nan')\">Data Driven Digital Twins for the Maritime Domain</a>, <a class=\"tooltip\" onclick=\"showPreview('Predictive Digital Twins for Autonomous Ships', 'A predictive digital twin of an autonomous ship is a continuously updated virtual representation of the physical ship that can be used to predict and prevent potential failures.

In this paper, the predictive digital twin is developed in three steps: (i) by describing the dynamics behaviour of the ships based on mechanistic models, (ii) by continuously updating the mechanistic models using data from sensor systems, and (iii) by predicting the faults and visualizing the results. To this end, the mechanistic model is derived from the first principles, while the updating algorithm is developed based on an adaptive exogenous Kalman filter.

Decarbonization is vital for emission mitigation using innovative technologies, policies, and incentives at a local and international level. In this context, the presented Integrated Ship Energy Flowchart (ISEF), aims to create a digital twin of a ship and carry out deterministic calculations, such as engine power requirements and by extension fuel consumption and emissions, by modelling the various components of a ship’s energy flow. Most modeling approaches depend on tracking data from automatic identification systems (AIS) and commercial vessel databases, accompanied with prohibitive costs for many, as well as missing vessel characteristics. ISEF, on the other hand, aims to fill in the gap in case of missing or costly to obtain data while maintaining the flexibility to utilize field data if available. This is done by providing representative vessel characteristics, detailed engine modeling and simulating components such as environmental conditions (sea-state, wind). At the same time, ISEF develops a library of vessel data including ship particulars, engine and route information among others. Thus, it is also suitable for the validation of tracking information and machine learning or other deterministic algorithms. Additionally, this library will enable the development of a statistically representative ship describing the international fleet. This will therefore improve projection algorithms utilized in calculations and aid the evaluation of mitigation options regarding decarbonisation in terms of the overall fleet. Such a model also enables the investigation of alternative fuels and fuel mixtures, route optimization, and inclusion of cold ironing amongst others.
